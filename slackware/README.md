# Slackware Mirrors

## Slackware 4.0

.tgz packages from Slackware 4.0 are all included already in `livecd/packages/slackware-4.0`.

Additional sources and support files are included for posterity, and for potential future inclusion in BasicLinux-LCARS.

Slackware 4.0 packages are, broadly, compatible with BasicLinux, 
though many of them require additional libraries to be installed first - see the BasicLinux documentation

## Slackware 9.0

Only `glibc2` is used from Slackware 9.0, and is included in `livecd/extras/slackware-9.0`.

The rest of the repo is only mirrored for posterity.

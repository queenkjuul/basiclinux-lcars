<p>
Normally <a href="baslinux.html">BasicLinux</a> boots from DOS. &nbsp; This works fine in Windows 95 and 98, which have a genuine DOS mode, but it does not work with more recent versions of Windows. &nbsp; If you are running Windows ME/NT/2K/XP (and have no access to DOS or Win95/98), you will need to make a floppy version of BasicLinux. &nbsp;This version is identical to the normal version of BasicLinux; it just takes longer to boot because it is loading from a floppy.
<p>  
You need two floppy disks for BasicLinux.  &nbsp;The first floppy is for a bootable Linux kernel.  &nbsp;The second floppy is for the compressed BasicLinux image-file. You also need a utility for transferring image-files to floppies.  &nbsp;If you do not already have such a utility, you can download RawWriteWin from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040513004709/http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/rawwrite.htm">here</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040513004709/http://www.fdos.org/ripcord/rawrite/readme.html">here</a>.

<li>Download the standard BasicLinux <a href="dl-main.html">package</a>. 
<li>Unzip baslin17.zip
<li>Use RawWriteWin (or similar) to transfer baslinux.gz to floppy
<p>
When your floppies are completed, put the first one in the floppy drive and reboot the computer.  &nbsp;If the floppy does not boot, you may need to adjust your system setup to allow booting from floppy.

BasicLinux on a parallel port ZIP drive
=======================================

This file (blppaz.gz) is a gzip'ed 1.44M floppy disk image. It allows you to
boot a BL root partition from a disk in a parallel port ZIP drive. Instead of
using the floppy, you can also boot from DOS. Read on for details.

To use, you'll need to gunzip the file. Then write the blppaz image file to a
1.44M floppy disk. From within BL3, use

dd if=blppaz of=/dev/fd0

Then make a /baslin directory on a ZIP disk. Copy the fs.img loopback image
from the BL3 loop version zip (bl3-32.zip) file to that directory. Move the
ZIP disk to a parallel port drive, and plug that into a PC. You can then boot
from the floppy you've just made.

You can also use a more traditional BL loopback boot. First copy the
/boot/initrd.gz file from the image file. Then replace the initrd.gz file from
the standard BL3 loop distribution with the one from the image. You can then
run the boot.bat batch file in DOS to boot off the ZIP drive.

This floppy works by using GRUB to load the BL3 kernel image. Then, the initial
ramdisk /linuxrc inserts the following modules to that kernel:

scsi_mod
sd_mod
parport
parport_pc
ppa

Finally, the /linuxrc mounts /dev/sda4 and tries to boot the /baslin/fs.img
loopback file from there.

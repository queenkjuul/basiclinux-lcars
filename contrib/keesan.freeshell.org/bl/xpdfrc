# Sample xpdfrc file
#
# The Xpdf tools look for a config file in two places:
# 1. ~/.xpdfrc
# 2. in a system-wide directory, typically /usr/local/etc/xpdfrc
#
# This sample config file demonstrates some of the more common
# configuration options.  Everything here is commented out.  You
# should edit things (especially the file/directory paths, since
# they'll likely be different on your system), and uncomment whichever
# options you want to use.  For complete details on config file syntax
# and available options, please see the xpdfrc(5) man page.
#
# Also, the Xpdf language support packages each include a set of
# options to be added to the xpdfrc file.

#----- display fonts

###X fonts section has been omitted.  This package is designed
####to use the included ghostscript fonts instead.
#### Fonts go into /usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts.

# These map the Base-14 fonts to the Type 1 fonts that ship with
# ghostscript.  You'll almost certainly want to use something like
# this, but you'll need to adjust this to point to wherever
# ghostscript is installed on your system.

#The following has been modified to Nimbus Sans fonts from ghostscript
#for both Times and Helvetica.  You could also display italic and bold
#and bolditalic as regular by changing all of the first four lines to
#n019043l.pfb and delete the other n019* fonts.  

#Courier is monospaced so leave it and symbols and dingbats.

# The full ghostscript fonts are about 3MB, these are 4.6K each x 10.
# If you installed the full ghostscript fonts from a Slackware package
# symlink to them from /usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts.

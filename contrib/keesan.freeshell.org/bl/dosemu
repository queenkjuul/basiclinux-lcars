DOSEMU for BL2
<H2>DOSEMU for BL2 </H2>

dosemu.tgz - Statically compiled by  David Moberg (but works for BL2 only) 
DOSEMU 1.3.2, which fixes several serious problems in older versions
such as lack of characters (A, S, i, etc.) <br>
1) installpkg dosemu.tgz  <br>

2) download  
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/dosemu/dosemu-freedos-b9r5-bin.tgz?download"> 
the required freedos file </a>, <br>
3) move and rename to /usr/share/dosemu/dosemu-freedos-bin.tgz<br>
Type dosemu and follow instructions to finish installing.  Do 
NOT follow instructions in README.bindist when using this
package.<br>
Tested working with WP5.1 for DOS under xdosemu (but if used with 
CLI dosemu, the Alt-F1 to F4 will switch terminals instead of acting
as WP commands and also you have to type very very slowly or many
letters won't even appear), with dosemu using a small text editor, and 
with xdosemu using a small CAD program.
WP4.2 for DOS works correctly even under plain dosemu.

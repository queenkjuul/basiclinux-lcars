First of all, if you have the new version there's plenty of 
documentation on it in /usr/doc/.

I'll explain it however:
The -C option specifies a config file. Config files are explained quite 
nicely if you read the page in /usr/doc/, and you set the options like so:

optionname=value

-p specifies a port. The default of 80 should be what you want.

-d specifies a dir to chdir to at startup.

-dd is related to chrooting, see the manual.

-c is for specifying your cgi-bin. Specify 'cgi-bin/**' (without the 
quotes) for anything in cgi-bin/. '**.cgi' (yet again, without the 
quotes) for all files ending in .cgi. Note that this path is relative to 
the directory specified with -d.

-u specifies a user to switch to after initialization as root. Default 
is nobody. If you leave this alone in BL3, it'll somehow magically 
change to nobody just fine, despite the user 'nobody' not being existing.

-h and -v are related to virtual hosting. See the manual.

-l specifies a log file name. Default is no logging.

-i specifies a pidfile (a file that it writes it's PID to)

-T specifies a character set to use when sending text files. Default 
should be fine.

-P specifies a P3P server header. See manual for details.

-M is related to caching, see manual for details.

-S is related to SSL, which I have disabled. Useless unless you 
recompile with SSL support.

-E is also related to SSL. Yet again, see the manual.

-D is for debug mode. Note, however that mini_httpd does not become a 
daemon in this mode, so it's great for a restart script.

-V prints the version and exits.

So, now that we have that covered, here's an example configuration file:

dir=/var/www/
cgipat=cgi-bin/**
logfile=/var/log/mini_httpd.log

With this configuration file, you'd put your files in /var/www/, and 
your cgi files in /var/www/cgi-bin/. It would log to 
/var/log/mini_httpd.log.

You would invoke mini_httpd like this:

mini_httpd -C /path/to/config/file

Hope this clears things up a bit. By the way, if you have an old version 
that does not have the (essential) manual in /usr/doc/, e-mail me for 
the new package. The manual is essential.

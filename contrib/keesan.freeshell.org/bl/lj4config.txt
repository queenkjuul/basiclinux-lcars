                                NOTE: When using DHCP, keep the setting DHCP = YES *. The DHCP server will configure the TCP/IP parameters on the HP Jetdirect. No other TCP/IP configuring is         
                                necessary.

                                13. Press the PLUS or VALUE button, until the desired value of the first byte of the IP address appears. By pressing and holding the PLUS or VALUE button, the value   
                                will scroll rapidly (HP LaserJet 4000, 5000, and 8000 printers have a MINUS button to decrease the value).                                                             
                                14. Press SELECT or RESUME to save the value.                                                                                                                          
                                15. Press ITEM to continue. Repeat Steps 11-13 to configure the remaining bytes of the IP address.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                Repeat Steps 11-13 to configure the subnet mask bytes (SM BYTE 1=), syslog server IP address (LG BYTE 1=), default gateway (GW BYTE 1=), and timeout (TIMEOUT=).

                                The following TCP/IP parameters can be configured using the front panel of the printer. The different models and firmware revisions of HP Jetdirect print servers have 
                                different capabilities and therefore different menus. Also, some menu items will only appear if the HP Jetdirect is connected to the network and configured (e.g., by  
                                DHCP) therefore the list of items below are not what you supposed to have available; rather, it is a description of those menu items that you might see on your        
                                particular printer:                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                Config Method: Allows you to choose between the available configuration methods for IP addresses (DHCP, BOOTP, etc.)                                                   
                                BootP= (Yes/No). Uses BOOTP or DHCP, which automatically downloads configuration data over the network. The default setting is YES to use BOOTP or DHCP for            
                                configuration. Change this to NO to use the front-panel configuration.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                DHCP=(Yes/No). Uses DHCP, which automatically downloads configuration data over the network. The default setting is YES to use DHCP for configuration. Change this to  
                                NO to use the front-panel configuration.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                Auto IP= (Yes/No). For firmware versions x.25.xx or newer. If you choose BOOTP=NO* and DHCP=NO*, you can choose AUTO IP=YES* to have a link-local default IP address   
                                of 169.254.x.x assigned automatically.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                Manual: (Yes/No). Allows the IP address to be configured using the front panel of the printer.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                DHCP Release. Only if the HP Jetdirect is configured by DHCP, this menu item will appear to release the IP address.                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                DHCP Renew. Only if the HP Jetdirect is configured by DHCP, this menu item will appear to renew or the IP address.                                                     
                                Host Name. Allows the host name to be entered in using the front panel of the printer. This only appears on certain printers with certain firmware and HP Jetdirect    
                                print servers with x.24.06 or newer firmware. Basically if the option isn't on the menu, the printer/print server combination does not have it available.              
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                Secure Web or Web= (HTTP/HTTPS). Sets the type of protocol used to access the embedded web server of the HP Jetdirect.                                                 
                                IP address (four bytes). This is usually seen on the front panel as IP BYTE. For example: If the IP address is 192.0.0.192, then IP byte 1 = 192, IP byte 2= 0, IP     
                                byte 3 = 0, and IP byte 4 = 192.                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                Subnet mask (four bytes). This is usually seen on the front panel as SM BYTE. Example: If the subnet mask address is 255.255.255.0, then IP byte 1 = 255, IP byte 2=   
                                255, IP byte 3 = 255, and IP byte 4 = 0.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                Syslog server IP address (four bytes). This is usually seen on the front panel as LG BYTE. Example: If the syslog IP address is 192.30.40.192, then IP byte 1 = 192,   
                                IP byte 2= 30, IP byte 3 = 40, and IP byte 4 = 192. If no syslog server is on the network, each byte should be left at zero. A syslog server is a server on the        
                                network that runs a syslog daemon and is used to receive syslog messages. This may be useful in identifying error conditions.                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                Default gateway (four bytes). This is usually seen on the front panel as GW BYTE. Example: If the Gateway IP address is 192.0.0.192, then IP byte 1 = 192, IP byte 2=  
                                0, IP byte 3 = 0, and IP byte 4 = 192.                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                Timeout=. Sets the TCP connection timeout (in seconds).

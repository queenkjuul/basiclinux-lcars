~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   The Linux PCI Utilities contain various utilities for dealing with the PCI
bus in Linux:

	- lspci: displays detailed information about all PCI busses and devices
	  in the system, replacing the original /proc/pci interface.

	- setpci: allows to read from and write to PCI device configuration
	  registers. For example, you can adjust the latency timers with it.

   See manual pages for more details.

   You _NEED_ kernel 2.1.82 or newer which supports /proc/bus/pci.

   If you have any bug reports or suggestions, send them to the author.

   If you want, subscribe to linux-pci@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz (send
"subscribe linux-pci Your Full Name" to listproc@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz).
Release notes about new versions will be send to the list and problems with
the Linux PCI support will be probably discussed there, too.

   You also might want to look at the pciutils web page containing release
notes and other news: http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~mj/pciutils.html.

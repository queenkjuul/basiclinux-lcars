x3270 Resources

Here is a complete list of the customizable X resources used by x3270, their
meanings, default values, command-line switches and menu options that change
them.

Note that any resource can be set on the command line with the -xrm switch.

x3270.activeIcon        Default false           Switch -activeicon
    This one is a lot of fun.  When set to true, x3270's icon becomes a live
    miniature of the screen display.  There are some limitations, spelled out
    in the man page.

x3270.allowResize       Default true
    When true, the x3270 window can be resized by the mouse (actually, by the
    window manager).  When false, the window can only be resized from menu
    options.  The purpose of disabling mouse resizing is to allow a window
    bigger than will fit on the screen, which some window managers (e.g., mwm)
    will not allow if permitted to resize it.

x3270.altCursor         Default false           Switch -set altCursor
                        Option Underline Cursor        -clear altCursor
                               Block Cursor
    When set to true, this causes x3270 to use with the alternate (underscore)
    cursor.

x3270.aplFont           Default 3270-apl
    The font used when in apl mode (when the -apl switch is used).  It is
    assumed that this is a 3270 font (one with the same ordering as 3270 and
    3270-12), but with special APL characters in place of accented (ISO
    Latin-1) characters.

x3270.background        Default white           Switches: -bg, -rv
    The background color for menus, buttons, and on monochrome X displays, the
    emulator window.

x3270.bellVolume        Default 0
    Controls the volume used when ringing the terminal bell.  The value
    ranges from -100 (silent) through 0 (normal) to +100 (loud).  Not all
    X servers can vary the bell volume, other than turning it on and off.
    This resource can be overridden by the x3270.visualBell resource, which
    if set to true, will replace the bell with a flash of the screen.

x3270.boldColor         Default cyan
    On color X displays in 3278 (pseudo-color) mode, this is the color of
    high-intensity text.  (See the description of boldFont for how it works on
    monochrome X displays.)

x3270.blankFill         Default false           Option Blank Fill
                        Switch -set blankFill
                               -clear blankFill
    When set to true, in 3270 mode x3270 will automatically convert trailing
    blanks in a field to nulls in order to insert a character, and will
    automatically convert leading nulls to blanks so that input data is not
    squeezed to the left.  This eliminates some of the quirkier behavior of
    real 3270 terminals.

x3270.charset           Default bracket         Switch -charset
    This defines the EBCDIC character set, that is, what glyph (image) is
    displayed for each EBCDIC code.

    For each character set x, an additional resource by the name of charset.x
    must be defined.

x3270.charset.us-intl
x3270.charset.us
x3270.charset.apl
x3270.charset.bracket
x3270.charset.oldibm
x3270.charset.german
x3270.charset.finnish
x3270.charset.uk
x3270.charset.norwegian
x3270.charset.french
x3270.charset.hebrew
    Individual character set definitions.  These resources consist of a series
    of newline-separated strings that define how an EBCDIC national character
    set differs from IBM's standard U.S.-International set (table 01).  Each
    string is a number, a colon, and a symbol.  The number is the EBCDIC code,
    and the symbol is an ASCII character or ISO Latin-1 name of the graphic it
    represents.

x3270.charsetList       Default U.S. International: us-intl
                                Bracket: bracket
                                German: german
                                Finnish: finnish
                                United Kingdom: uk
                                Norwegian: norwegian
                                French: french
                                Hebrew: hebrew
    Defines the "Character Set" pull-right menu.

x3270.colorBackground   Default black
    The background color for the emulator window.  This resource is used only
    on color X displays when the x3270.model specifies 3278 (pseudo-color)
    mode.  On monochrome X displays, the background color is white, unless -rv
    (reverse video) is selected on the command line; in 3279 mode, the screen
    background is determined by the x3270.colorScheme resource.

x3270.colorScheme       Default default
                        Options Default 3279: default
                                Bright: bright
                                Reverse: reverse
                                Green Screen: greenScreen
    Defines the colors used to paint the emulator window in 3279 (full-color)
    mode.  This resource is used only when the "x3270.model" specifies a 3279
    display.  For each color scheme x, an additional resources by the name of
    colorScheme.x must be defined.

x3270.colorScheme.default
x3270.colorScheme.reverse
x3270.colorScheme.bright
x3270.colorScheme.cpe
x3270.colorScheme.greenScreen
    Individual color scheme definitions.  Each resource is a list of 23 items:
     0  X color to use for IBM "neutral/black" (also used as ANSI color 0)
     1  X color to use for IBM "blue" (also used for ANSI color 4)
     2  X color to use for IBM "red" (also used for ANSI color 1)
     3  X color to use for IBM "pink" (also used for ANSI color 5)
     4  X color to use for IBM "green" (also used for ANSI color 2)
     5  X color to use for IBM "turquiose"
     6  X color to use for IBM "yellow" (also used for ANSI color 3)
     7  X color to use for IBM "neutral/white"
     8  X color to use for IBM "black"
     9  X color to use for IBM "deep blue"
     10 X color to use for IBM "orange"
     11 X color to use for IBM "purple"
     12 X color to use for IBM "pale green"
     13 X color to use for IBM "pale turquiose" (also used for ANSI color 6)
     14 X color to use for IBM "grey"
     15 X color to use for IBM "white" (also used for ANSI color 7)
     16 X color to use if one of 0..15 cannot be allocated (white or black)
     17 X color to use as the default screen background
     18 X color to use as the select background
     19 IBM color index (0..15) to use for unprotected, unhighlighted fields
     20 IBM color index (0..15) to use for unprotected, highlighted fields
     21 IBM color index (0..15) to use for protected, unhighlighted fields
     22 IBM color index (0..15) to use for protected, highlighted fields

x3270.composeMap        Default latin1
    Gives the name of the map used to define the pairs of characters that
    form composite characters with the Compose key.

x3270.composeMap.latin1
x3270.composeMap.apl
    For each compose map x, an additional resource by the name of composeMap.x
    must be defined.  Each line in the resource is of the form
    "keysym1 + keysym2 = keysym3", meaning "when the Compose key is pressed,
    followed by keysym1 and keysym2 (in either order), interpret it as
    keysym3."  The definitions are case-sensitive.

x3270.cursorBlink       Default false           Switch -set cursorBlink
                                                       -clear cursorBlink
    When set to true, this causes x3270 to use a blinking cursor.

x3270.cursorColor       Default red
    On color X displays, this is the color of the text cursor.  This resource
    is used only if the x3270.useCursorColor resource is set to true.

x3270.cursorPos         Default true            Switch -set cursorPos
                        Option Track Cursor            -clear cursorPos
    When set to true, causes x3270 to display the cursor location on the
    status line.

x3270.debugFont         Default 3270d
    The name of the font recognized as the "debug" font.  (When x3270 thinks
    it is using a debug font, it uses a different, slower method to draw the
    screen.)  It is assumed that this is a 3270 font (one with the same
    ordering as 3270 and 3270-12), but with printable graphics in place of
    the NULL and field attribute characters, which are normally blank.

    Usually, the "Debug Font" menu option selects this font.

x3270.debugTracing      Default true
    If set to true, options are available on the File menu to trace the 3270
    data stream and X events.  If set to false, these options are not
    displayed.

x3270.doConfirms        Default true
    When set to true, x3270 will display a pop-up to report successful
    completion of certain operations, such as screen printing.  When
    set to false, these pop-ups are not displayed.

x3270.dsTrace           Default false            Switch -trace
                        Option Trace Data Stream        -set dsTrace
                                                        -clear Trace
    When true, x3270 writes a hexadecimal representation of all network
    traffic, and its interpretation, into the file /tmp/x3trc.<pid>.  It
    also pops up a window to watch the file as it is created, with the
    pathname of the file as the window title.  The command run in the window
    is defined by the traceCommand resource.  The directory prefix is
    defined by the traceDir resource.

x3270.emulatorFont      Default 3270 (*)        Switch -efont
                        Options 3270 Font (14 point): 3270
                                8-point Font: 3270gt8
                                12-point Font: 3270-12
                                16-point Font: 3270gt16
                                20-point Font: 3270-20
                                24-point Font: 3270gt24
                                32-point Font: 3270gt32
                                Debug Font: 3270d
                                Other Font...
    The font used for the emulator window.  By default it is 3270, a 14-pixel
    clone of a real 3278 display font.  A nice substitution is 3270-12, which
    is a little more compact.  Actually, x3270 can use any X font, so long as
    it uses constant spacing.  However, only 3270 and 3270-12 allow displaying
    all special symbols on the status line.

    (*) Actually, the default for emulatorFont is the value of the first font
    in the x3270.fontList resource, below.

x3270.eof               Default ^D
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.erase             Default ^?
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special characters used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    functions as the "stty" parameters of the same name.

    When connected in ANSI character-at-a-time mode (when x3270 sends each
    keystroke to the host), this is the ASCII character that is sent to
    the host in response to the Erase action.

x3270.eventTrace        Default false            Switch -set eventTrace
                        Option Trace X Events           -clear eventTrace
    When true, x3270 traces information about the X events that it processes
    into the file /tmp/x3trc.<pid>.  It also pops up a window to watch the
    file as it is created, with the pathname of the file as the window title.
    The command run in the window is defined by the traceCommand resource.
    The directory prefix is defined by the traceDir resource.

x3270.extended          Default false           Switch -extended
    *** DEPRECATED RESOURCE -- REPLACED BY NEW x3270.model SYNTAX ***
    If set to true, enables support of the 3270 Extended Data Stream, which
    allows extended highlighting, structured fields, and query reply.  The
    actual difference is that a "-E" is appended to the default terminal
    name which is passed to the host through TELNET negotiations, indicating
    support for the feature.  If the x3270.m3279 resource is true,
    x3270.extended is automatically assumed to be true as well.

x3270.fontList          Default: 3270 Font (14 point): 3270
                                 8-point Font: 3270gt8
                                 12-point Font: 3270-12
                                 16-point Font: 3270gt16
                                 20-point Font: 3270-20
                                 24-point Font: 3270gt24
                                 32-point Font: 3270gt32
                                 Debug Font: 3270d
The list of menu labels and font names that appear on the Options menu.
The first name on the list is used as the default emulator font.

x3270.foreground        Default black           Switches: -fg, -rv
    The foreground color for menus, buttons, and on monochrome X displays, the
    emulator display.

x3270.hostsFile         Default /usr/lib/X11/x3270/ibm_hosts
    The name of a file listing the host names that appear on the "Connect"
    pull-down menu.  The format of the file is explained on the ibm_hosts man
    page.

x3270.iconFont          Default nil2
    The font used to paint the text inside the active icon.  "nil2" is a
    one-by-two pixel font that produces a "greeked" picture of the screen
    image.

x3270.iconLabelFont     Default 8x13
    When activeIcon and labelIcon are true, this is the name of the font used
    to paint the icon label.

x3270.icrnl             Default true
    Used in ANSI mode; similar to the "stty" parameter of the same name.
    Controls whether input carriage returns are mapped to newlines.

x3270.inlcr             Default false
    Used in ANSI mode; similar to the "stty" parameter of the same name.
    Controls whether input newlines are mapped to carriage returns.

x3270.inputColor        Default orange
    On color X displays in 3278 (pseudo-color) mode, this is the color of
    light-pen selectable fields.  If the resource x3270.modifiedSel is set to
    true, modified fields are also displayed in this color.  On monochrome X
    displays, these fields are indistinguishable from other normal-intensity
    text.

x3270.intr              Default ^C
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.invertKeypadShift Default false
    When set to true, this causes the PF1-PF12 and PF13-PF24 keys on the
    pop-up keypad to be swapped.  Normally, the low-numbered keys appear;
    when Shift, Alt, Ctrl or Meta is pressed, the high-numbered keys appear.
    With this resource set to true, that is reversed.

x3270.keymap            No Default              Switch -keymap
    The name of the keyboard map to use.  If no keymap resource is specified,
    the environment variables KEYMAP and KEYBD are checked (in that order) for
    the keymap name.

    For each keymap x, an additional resource by the name x3270.keymap.x must
    be defined, which gives the actual key mappings.  These are in X
    translation table format.

    The name may be followed by any number of comma-separated modifier names,
    e.g., if the keymap name "sun-k4,ow", means keymap "sun-k4" and modifier
    "ow".

    For each keymap modifier x, an additional resource by the name
    x3270.keymap.x must be defined, which gives the actual key mappings.
    These are also in X translation table format.

x3270.keymap.sun-k5
x3270.keymap.sun-k4
x3270.keymap.sun-k3
x3270.keymap.ncd
x3270.keymap.hp-k1
x3270.keymap.hp-pc
    These are predefined keymaps.

x3270.keymap.ow
x3270.keymap.apl
x3270.keymap.alt
x3270.keymap.t
x3270.keymap.finnish7
x3270.keymap.norwegian7
    These are predefined keymap modifiers:
    - "ow" makes the mouse work more like OpenWindows defaults
    - "apl" is automatically applied when in apl mode (the -apl switch is used)
    - "alt" maps many of the "Meta" key actions to "Alt" key actions, for
        keyboards which lack a "Meta" key
    - "t" is useful for keymap debugging; it maps Meta-z to an action that
        displays the current keymap
    - "finnish7" and "norwegian7" are for compatibility with certain 7-bit
        international keyboards

x3270.keypad            Default right
    This controls the position of the pop-up keypad.  It can have one of
    four values: left, meaning a pop-up window positioned to the left of the
    main x3270 window; right, meaning a pop-up window positioned to the right
    of the main x3270 window; bottom, meaning a pop-up window positioned below
    the main x3270 window; and integral, making the keypad an extension of the
    bottom of the main window itself.

x3270.keypad.keyHeight  Default 24
    The height in pixels of all of the buttons on the keypad.

x3270.keypad.keyWidth   Default 48
    The width in pixels of the lower tier of buttons on a horizontal keypad.

x3270.keypad.largeKeyWidth      Default 56
    The width in pixels of the lower tier of buttons on a vertical keypad.

x3270.keypad.paWidth    Default 36
    The width in pixels of PA and cursor keys on the keypad.

x3270.keypad.pfWidth    Default 32
    The width in pixels of PF keys on the keypad.

x3270.keypadBackground  Default grey70
    On color X displays, this is the color of the empty area behind the buttons
    on the main window and keypad window.  On monochrome X displays, these
    areas are filled with a 50% grey bitmap.

x3270.keypadOn          Default false
    If set to true, the keypad will automatically appear when x3270 is started.

x3270.kill              Default ^U
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special characters used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    functions as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

    When connected in ANSI character-at-a-time mode (when x3270 sends each
    keystroke to the host), this is the ASCII characters that is sent to
    the host in response to the DeleteField action.

x3270.labelIcon         Default false
    When activeIcon is true, MIT's twm window manager will not put a label on
    x3270's icon.  Setting labelIcon to true causes x3270 to supply its own
    label for the icon.

x3270.lineWrap          Default true            Switch -set lineWrap
                        Option Wraparound              -clear lineWrap
    When set to true, in ANSI mode x3270 will automatically insert a
    Newline then output reaches the end of a line.  When false, output can
    pile up at the end of each line.

x3270.lnext             Default ^V
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.lockedCursor      Default X_cursor
    The name of the mouse cursor displayed with x3270 is not connected to a
    host.

x3270.m3279             Default false           Switch -color
    *** DEPRECATED RESOURCE -- REPLACED BY NEW x3270.model SYNTAX ***
    If true and running on a color X display, x3270 runs in full 3279 color
    mode.  If false, x3270 runs in 3278 (pseudo-color) mode, with colors
    representing different field attributes.

x3270.macros
x3270.macros.host1
x3270.macros.host2
    Defines a set of macros assigned to a pull-down menu that appears when
    connected to a host.  The syntax is similar to a keymap (an X11 translation
    table), except that rather than a keysym name, the left-hand side is a
    name that will appear on the menu.  Any single action can be specified
    on the right-hand side.

    Definitions of the form "x3270.macros.<xxx>" define the macros menu when
    connected to host <xxx>, which override the "x3270.macros" definitions.

x3270.marginedPaste     Default false           Switch -set marginedPaste
                        Option Paste With Left Margin  -clear marginedPaste
    When set to true, x3270 will use the current cursor position as a left
    margin for pasted data: no pasted data will be input into an area to the
    left of the current cursor positon.

x3270.menuBar           Default true
    If set to false, the menu bar will not be displayed at the top of the
    x3270 main window.  The three pull-down menus are still available, however,
    by pressing Ctrl and each of the mouse buttons.

x3270.model             Default 3278-4-E (mono) Switch -model
                                3279-4-E (color)
                        Options Model 2
                                Model 3
                                Model 4
                                Model 5
    The terminal model that x3270 is emulating.  The model is in three parts,
    separated by dashes; each part is optional.
        3278 or 3279
            "3278" specifies a monochrome 3270 display.  If used on a color
             X display, it will cause fields to be drawn in pseudo-color
             (different colors for different field attributes).  This is
             the default for monochrome X displays.
            "3279" specifies a color 3270 display.  This is the default for
             color X displays.
        2, 3, 4 or 5
            The model number, which determines the size of the screen.  The
             default is 4.
        E
            An optional suffix which specifies support for the 3270 Extended
             Data Stream (color, extended attributes, query reply).  3279
             implies E.

x3270.modifiedSel       Default false
    When true in 3278 (pseudo-color) mode, modified fields appear in the
    "input" (light pen selectable) color.  When false, modified fields are
    displayed in the same colors as unmodified fields.

x3270.mono              Default false           Switch -mono
    If set to true, x3270 will operate as if it were running on a monochrome X
    display.

x3270.monoCase          Default false           Switch -set monoCase
                        Option Monocase                -clear monoCase
    When true, causes x3270 to run in uppercase-only mode.

x3270.noOther           Default false
    If set to true, the "Other" options are disabled for selecting fonts
    and connecting to hosts, limiting users to the options provided on
    the menus.

x3270.numericLock       Default false
    When true, causes x3270 to lock the keyboard when non-numeric data is
    entered into fields with the Numeric attribute.

x3270.normalColor       Default green
    On color X displays in 3278 (pseudo-color) mode, this is the color of
    normal-intensity text.  On monochrome X displays, normal text uses the
    foreground color.

x3270.oerrLock          Default true
    If set to true, operator errors (typing into protected fields, insert
    overflow, etc.) will cause the keyboard to lock with an error message
    on the status line.  If set to false, the terminal bell will ring,
    without any keyboard lock or message.

x3270.once              Default false           Switch -once
    When true, x3270 will exit as soon as a host disconnects.

x3270.oversize                                  Switch -oversize
    Sets the screen dimensions to be larger than the default for the
    chosen model.  Its value is a string in the format "COLSxROWS".  It is
    used only if the value of "x3270.model" includes a "-E" (extended
    data stream) suffix, and if the specified dimensions are larger than
    the model number defaults.  Also, only hosts that support the Query Reply
    structured field will function properly with x3270 in this mode.

x3270.port              Default telnet          Switch -port
    The name of the default TCP port for x3270 to connect to.  This can be
    either a symbolic name from /etc/services, or an integer.

x3270.printTextCommand  Default lpr
    The shell command used by the PrintText action.  An ASCII image of the
    3270 display becomes the standard input to this command.  If the first
    character of the command is '@', the usual pop-up windows before and after
    the text is printed will not appear.

x3270.printWindowCommand        Default xwd -id %d | xpr | lpr
    The shell command used by the PrintWindow action.  The X window identifier
    of the main x3270 window is substituted for any "%d" in the command.  If
    the first character of the command is '@', the usual pop-up windows before
    and after the window is printed will not appear.

x3270.quit              Default ^\\
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.rectangleSelect   Default false           Switch -set rectangleSelect
                        Option Select by Rectangles    -clear rectangleSelect
    When set to true, x3270 will always select rectangular areas of the
    screen.  When false, x3270 will select rectangular areas in 3270 mode, but
    in ANSI mode it will select continuous areas of the screen like xterm.

x3270.resizeFontList    Default: 3270 3279-12 3270gt8

    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

x3270.saveLines         Default 64              Switch -sl
    The number of display lines to save for the scroll bar.

x3270.schemeList        Default Default 3279: default
                                Bright: bright
                                Reverse: reverse
                                Green Screen: greenScreen
    Lists the options on the Color Scheme menu.

x3270.screenTrace       Default false           Switch -set screenTrace
                        Option Save Screen(s) in File  -clear screenTrace
    When true, x3270 will save an ASCII version of the screen image in
    the file /tmp/x3scr.<pid>, every time it is redrawn.  The directory
    prefix is defined by the traceDir resource.

x3270.scripted          Default false           Switch -scripted
    When true, x3270 will read commands from standard input.  The rules for
    these commands are documented in x3270script(1).

x3270.scrollBar         Default false           Switches -sb, +sb
                        Option Scrollbar                 -set scrollBar
                                                         -clear scrollBar
    When true, x3270 will display a scroll bar to the right of the emulator
    window.

x3270.secure            Default false
    When true, x3270 will prevent users from executing arbitrary commands
    from within the program.  In particular, the "Execute Action" menu
    option is disabled, as are the pop-ups which allow editing the commands
    for "Print Screen Text" and "Print Window Bitmap".  See the x3270.noOther
    resource for additional security options.

x3270.selectBackground  Default dim gray
    On color X displays, this is the background color used for selected text
    (text highlighted with the mouse for cut and paste).  On monochrome
    X displays, selected text is in reverse video.

x3270.showTiming        Default false           Switch -set showTiming
                        Option Show Timing             -clear showTiming
    When true, x3270 will display on the status line the time that the host
    takes to unlock the keyboard after an AID is sent.

x3270.termName          Default IBM-327x-n      Switch -tn
    An alternate name to be sent in response to the host's "DO OPTION
    TERMINAL-NAME" request.  The default is "IBM-" followed bu the value of
    the "x2370.model" resource.

x3270.traceCommand      Default tail -f
    The command that is run in the trace monitor window, with its standard
    input redirected from the trace file.  If given the value 'none', no
    monitor window will be created.

x3270.traceDir          Default /tmp
    Defines the directory that data stream traces and screen images are saved
    in.

x3270.typeahead         Default true
    When true, x3270 will store keystrokes in a buffer when the keyboard is
    locked.  When false, these keystrokes will be dropped.

x3270.useCursorColor    Default false
    If set to false, the cursor is drawn using the same color as the text
    behind it.  If set to true, on color X displays the cursor is drawn with
    the color specified by the x3270.cursorColor resource.

x3270.visualBell        Default false
    When true, x3270 will flash the screen in response to an ALARM WCC or
    BELL character, rather than ringing the X display's bell.

x3270.waitCursor        Default watch
    The name of the mouse cursor displayed when x3270 is connected to a host,
    but is unable to process keyboard input.  Cursor names are in the file
    <X11/cursorfont.h>.

x3270.werase            Default ^W
    Used in ANSI mode, when communicating in line-at-a-time mode (when x3270
    gathers a line of input before forwarding it to the host).  Defines a
    special character used for editing input, and has exactly the same
    function as the "stty" parameter of the same name.

    When connected in ANSI character-at-a-time mode (when x3270 sends each
    keystroke to the host), this is the ASCII character that is sent to
    the host in response to the DeleteWord action.

x3270*keyPad*large*font Default fixed
    The font used to paint the "large" labels on the keys in the keypad, i.e.,
    the PA and PF keys.

x3270*keyPad*small*font Default -*-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

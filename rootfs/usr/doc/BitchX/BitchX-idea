Jayzus... root'll kill me if he finds me fiddling with the bins ;)

Ok... here's the rest (bugs/suggestions). BX docs are pretty basic, so I
just follow the 'hey, what does this button do?' thing. I could add some
of the missing stuff to the help file- if I figure out what some of those
'00ps' thingys do.

(On SunOS 5.5.1)
RBIND ...seg faults. plain and simple.
BIND (no params)  ... seg faults
SET -REALNAME ... seg faults (known ircII bug)
SET -SHOW_NUMERICS_STR  ...seg faults
FTP  ... seg faults (SET to ncftp, didn't try with plain ftp)

LUSERS ...BitchX type /about appears each time. How about making it appear
 on startup or only following the MOTD
DEOP ...darn, I'm used to DOP to deop and DEOP to deoper :P
KICKIDLE ...just how idle is 'idle' and does it accept params (idle time)
SHOWIDLE ...always shows you as being idle all the time you've been on the
 channel

Update IRCop count on status bar when you oper yourself.
Seperate setting for exemption from flood control on the userlist. (like
 letting someone flood without giving them userlevel 90)
Variable for current server as there is for current channel (always wanted
 that in ircII)
Display of number of channel bans on the status bar without having to do
 messy scripting
Easy way to set topic on timer (for us lazy buggers who don't want to
 script it ;)
Important- better flood control. I invariably flood off killing large
 numbers of clones with /whokill- hope masskicks don't cause the same
 problem. Didn't have this prob using the whokill ircii script.
Something to unignore the last ignore with no messy typing or interactive
 unignore like in TBAN.
Dunno if I've messed something up here, but incoming CTCP ACTIONs appear
 the same, whether private(describe) or public.
In UPTIME output, last msg/notice will be any PRIVMSG/NOTICE to/from you,
 including CTCPs/CTCP replies. Seperate them?
Autorename the logfile if a file with that name exists.
Built in command for timed bans- can't live without it unless they replace
 the limit of 20 bans in ircd.
Leave the +fckrwhatever umodes off if the show* are set off and OV is also
 off. That's a lot of unnecessary traffic if you don't want to see them.
 Plus, they only generate error messages on servers which don't support
 those umodes (using a 2.9.2 IRCnet server requires additional scripting
 anyway since server notices look different)
Extra bantype which will ban *@host. With dialup lamerz everywhere this is
 an effective way to get rid of them without banning the site even if they
 change usernames.
And, of course, make SET SHOW_NUMERICS ON actually show numerics. :)

Heh... looks like you've got your work cut out for you ;) We're never
satisfied, are we? Whatever, BX -bugs or no bugs- sure is an improvment on
plain ircii.

Signature wanted. Apply within. The ideal candidate should be under five
lines and never in the past have been employed in the spam industry.

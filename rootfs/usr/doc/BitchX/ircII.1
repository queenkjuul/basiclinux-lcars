.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I ircII
program is a full screen, termcap based interface to Internet Relay Chat.
It gives full access to all of the normal
.I IRC
functions, plus a variety of additional options.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-c " chan"
Automatically join channel
.I chan .
.TP
.BI \-p " portno"
Set the port number to
.I portno
(default: 6667, the standard
.I IRC
port).
Only supply this if you connect to a server which uses a port other than 6667.
.TP
.B \-f
Use flow control (^S and ^Q) to stop/start the display.
Normally these are both bound to other functions within
.IR irc .
This switch is ignored if the
.B \ -d
switch is used.
.TP
.B \-F
Don't use flow control (^S and ^Q) to stop start the display.
This switch is ignored if the
.B \ -d
switch is used.
.TP
.B \-s
Don't start up the ircio process to connect to the
.I IRC
server (default).
.TP
.B \-S
Start up the ircio process to connect to the
.I IRC
server.
.TP
.B \-d
Start in "dumb" mode.
All input is taken directly from stdin and all output goes to stdout
without using any of the
.IR termcap (5)
screen control codes.
.TP
.I nickname
Set the nickname
(overrides the environment variable
.BR IRCNICK ;
default: the username).
.TP
.I server
Set the list of servers with which
.B irc
will try to connect upon startup.
This list is also used by the program's
.B /server
command.
The format for lines in the list is:
.IP
.B hostname
.RB [:portno[:password[:nick]]]
.TP
.BI \-l " filename"
Selects a different file to be used as the .ircrc file for 
.B ircII.
There is no exansion of $ expandos when using this option.
The default is $HOME/.ircrc.
.TP
.BI \-L " filename"
Selects a different file to be used as the .ircrc file for
.B ircII.
Expansion of $ expandos happens with this option.  
The default is $HOME/.ircrc.
.TP
.BI \-a
This adds the normal
.B irc
server list to the command line list of
.B irc
servers.
.TP
.BI \-v
Print the version and release date of
.I ircII
and exit.
.TP
.BI \-q
Start up
.B irc
quickly -- don't load the IRCRC file.
.SH "DETAILED DESCRIPTION"
.SS "The Screen:"
The
screen is split into two parts, separated by an inverse-video
status line (if supported).
The upper (larger) part of the screen displays responses from the
.I IRC
server.
The lower part of the screen (a single line) accepts keyboard input.
.LP
Some terminals do not support certain features required by
.IR ircII ,
in which case you receive a message stating this.
If this occurs, try changing the terminal type or run
.I ircII
with the
.B -d
option.
.SS "Irc Commands:"
Any line beginning with the slash character '/' is regarded as an
.I ircII
command (the command character may be changed; type '/help set cmdchar').
Any line not beginning with this character is treated as a message to
be sent to the current channel.
To produce a listing of commands, type '/help ?'.
To receive information about the commands type '/help
.B <command> '.
.SS "The .ircrc File:"
When
.I ircII
is executed, it checks the user's home directory for a
.I \&.ircrc
file, executing the commands in the file. Commands in this file do not
need to have a leading slash character '/'
This allows predefinition of aliases and other features.
.SH EXAMPLES

.I IRC
to port number 5555 of the default host and enter on channel number 128.

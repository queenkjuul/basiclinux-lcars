Here's some quick documentation on /set format_*'s

Most of the format's can be overridden by /on's.
A format can be deleted, which effectively get's rid of that message period.
ie   /set -format_Away   internal away is effectively cancelled.

Colors selections.

%W %w	Bold while and white
%K %k	Bold black and black
%G %g	Bold Green and green
%Y %y	Bold Yellow and yellow
%C %c	Bold Cyan and Cyan
%B %b	Bold Blue and blue
%P %p	Bold Purple or Magenta and purple or Magenta
%M %m	"	"	"	"	"	"
%R %r	Bold Red and red
%n	No color or color off.

All alias's and ircii $ variables can be used within a format.

$[-30.]0  will pad left a variable using . instead of spaces for the pad.

To figure out what a /set format* actually will show you set the format
variable to $0-  this will show you the parameters returned. There are a few
instances of of a invisible character being returned. These will disappear
as I rediscover them. I needed them as a place holder and a space or other
character just wouldn't do it.

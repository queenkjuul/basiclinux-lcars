### /BK BUG #1
Ban that existed and was made by TheCowBoy:
	*!*homo@*.isdn.online.no

However, I did /bk asskicker and the following happened:
	mode change [-o+ asskicker] on #xxx by _bk_
	asskicker was kicked from #xxx

After removing the ban, /bk worked perfectly:
	mode change [-b *!*homo@*.isdn.online.no] on #xxx by _bk_
	mode change [+b *!*@*.online.no] on #xxx by _bk_
	asskicker was kicked from #xxx

This is who I was trying to /bk and his user@host.
Nick: asskicker Host: homo@bergen308.online.no

### /BK BUG #2
mode change [-o+b RainFall *!*fuckstali@*.UU.NET] on #xxx by _bk
[RainFall] was kicked off #xxx by [_bk] [Get your terminology corrected.]
[RainFall] [fuckstalin@Cust57.Max19.Seattle.WA.MS.UU.NET] has joined #xxx
<arley> :))
mode change [-b *!*fuckstali@*.UU.NET] on #xxx by TheCowboy

Notice the length of the username on rainfall's address. BitchX ignored
the last character of the full username. Who said this was a bug? ;p

### Miscellaneous bug:
^C 5 times on start up causes an unrequired message to appear:
	Connecting to port 6667 of server efnet.telstra.net.au
	BitchX-71alpha11 -- just do it.
	[17:11:41] [~] #

### Format modification:
How about a title concerning the current channel with timestamp and
removing altogether the channel field from each user. eg:
    ::: Channel userlist for #BitchX at (12:00):
    ::: [ Nickname ] [  level ] User@Hostname
    ::: [ BarK0de  ] [ 90:2:2 ] gumbee@ewheat.org

Sasteroids v1.3  - source distribution
=======================================

Needed		:  gcc 2.5.8, svgalib 1.11, root access
Install summary	:  Edit the file named 'config' , then run 'make install'

********************************INSTALLATION**********************************

You must be 'root' to install the game.

	Please use gcc 2.5.8 or later, the associated C++ library stuff (if
you can compile and run a C++ program, you've got it), and svgalib 1.11 or
greater (available at sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/ ).

	You don't have to edit the Makefile, as any options you might want
to change are in the file 'config'.

	The game consists of the executable file 'sasteroids', which is
placed in /usr/games during installation.  This can be changed by editing
BINDIR in the file 'config'.  The file 'sast.cf' contains graphics, and is
placed in BINDIR also.

	The high score list is stored in sast.scores, created and maintained
automatically by sasteroids in the /var/games directory (change this
location by editing VARDIR in 'config').  You can copy the old file
'.SastScores' to '/var/games/sast.scores' if you used version 1.0 and want
to keep your high-score list.

	By default, the game will be compiled without joystick support.
Edit 'config' to set JOYSTICK=YES if you have the joystick kit installed (this is a separate
package available through ftp.  I used version 0.6).

	If you want to see a spacey backdrop while playing the game, set
BACKDROPS=YES.  Note that this may slow down the game on low CPU speed
computers with slow video cards. By default this is set to YES.

Untar the distribution (of course, you've already done this ;-)
	tar zxvvof sasteroids1.3-src.tar.gz

Or if your tar doesn't have the 'z' option:
	gzip -dc sasteroids1.3-src.tar.gz | tar xvvof - 
	cd sasteroids1.3

Edit the file named 'config' (if needed) as noted above.
You must run 'make install' before playing the game.
To compile and install, as ROOT, type:
	make install

To play the game, run the program:
	sasteroids

See 1-PROBLEMS if the program didn't compile.

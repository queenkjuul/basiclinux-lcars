Sasteroids ChangeLog

(See bottom of README file for credits)

v1.2 to 1.3 (minor update)
==========================
	No sound yet! I'm working on it :-)

	Added a spacey backdrop during game play (thanks to John Remyn
        for the idea). You can turn this off by setting "BACKDROPS=NO" in
        the 'config' file before compiling, which you should do if you find
        the game is running too slow.

	You can now switch virtual consoles (vc's) during *game play* if you:
	1) pause the game by pressing 'p' first
	or,
	2) press 'q' to get the "End this game (y/n)" prompt.

	Compiling is much faster and requires MUCH less memory :-)  Why?
        All bitmaps are in a '.cf' file (thanks again to John Remyn for
        code/ideas/etc), instead of being compiled into the game code.

	Small changes in game play, more floating point code removed, etc..

	Minor bug fixes in level changing, and entering high score names.

	Changed format of highscore file from text to binary.  Gets rid of a
        few problems when spaces entered in a name.  Score files will
        automatically be updated to the new format by sasteroids.

	Default name for high score list taken from login name.

v1.1 to 1.2
============
	Added proper keyboard support for game play (using scancodes).
	Press the left arrow key to start rotating left, release the key to
	stop rotating, etc..  Note that you lose vc-switching (ALT-F?)
	during game play.  I'll try to fix this in a future version.

	99% of floating point math replaced with fixed point math. Results
	in a big speed increase on computer's without a FPU.

	A new alien that sort-of morphs from the medium sized asteroid.
        Doesn't shoot, just stumbles around trying to crash into you.  It
        takes a few shots to kill him.

	Changed the movement of the enemy spaceships to be a little more
	evil :-)

	More levels added, and the game play has changed a bit.  The
        shooting alien is a little tougher, but appears less often when the
        screen is filled with asteroids.

	New fonts.

	Fixed up the joystick control. Version 1.1 didn't allow for turning
	and thrusting at the same time.

	After crashing, indicator shows where your next ship will be placed.

	Changed color of enemy bullet so it's not confused with your own.

	Added the current level and # of shields remaining (either 1 or 0) to
	the bottom status line.

	Fixed bug in HiScore where some scores could be wiped out if blank
	names entered into list.

	The .xpm files we taking alot of space in the source distribution
	and weren't needed to compile the game, therefore I removed them
	and created a third package containing the tools needed to
	edit the graphics in the game.  email me if you want this, and
	I'll make it available.

	Billions and billions of other tiny changes.


v1.0 to v1.1
============

Compiling problems were fixed:

	Fixed up a few #include paths that were incorrect. Also got rid of
	the half-baked dependancies in the makefile.

	Removed the need to have ncurses installed.  Ncurses was only used
        for some simple keyboard handling.

	The high-scores file is no longer stored in the current directory,
	but is placed in /var/games (or where ever you wish). Also, the file
	is renamed from '.SastScores' to 'sast.scores' (no longer a hidden
	file)

Game control: 
	Added in joystick support - you need to have the joystick patches
        compiled into the kernel to use this (as of 1.0.9, the patches need
        to be applied).  If you don't have the joystick patches, or a
        joystick, you can still use the keyboard for control.

	Joytick control is:
	UP		Thrust
	LEFT		Rotate Left
	RIGHT		Rotate Right
	DOWN		Shield On
	BUTTON A	Fire, and start new ship
	BUTTON B	Hyperspace

Performance: 
	Performance under varying CPU loads should be better, but still
	not great.

	Removed floating point math from the explosion routines - should
        speed up the game a bit for users without a math co-pro.  This is
        still under development, and there's lots of fp math in other places.


Who cares:
	Lots more of the code was re-written in C++

	I've added the bitmaps I created for the game to the source
        distribution.  The files are in 'xpm' format.  See 1-BITMAPS if you
        feel like changing them (not included in binary distribution).

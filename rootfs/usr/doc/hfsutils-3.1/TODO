===============================================================================

General to-do items (aka bugs):

  libhfs

  * don't allow reads from spared blocks
  * further improve efficiency of b*-tree searches?
  * concurrency considerations: opening same file multiple times;
      performing directory manipulations on open files
  * b*-tree record balancing?
  * smarter block allocation algorithm
  * volume full: hfs_write() should return bytes written < len, return -1
      on next call?
  * seek beyond end of file?
  * touch directory timestamps on file updates?
  * glob hcopy destination HFS path?
  * improve efficiency of bitmap operations
  * improve efficiency of search operations

  librsrc

  * determine resource sizes without reading them
  * support writability

  hfsck

  * modify libhfs to support low-level grubbing

  command-line tools

  * write linux utilities mkfs.hfs, fsck.hfs
  * eliminate ftruncate()
  * more flags for hdel (-i, -r, -f)
  * glob :*:foo correctly
  * formalize hdisk.pl into the distribution

  xhfs

  * open arbitrary partitions
  * rename volumes
  * change file type/creator
  * more support for other platforms (correct device defaults; df output)
  * graphical partition map editor?
  * recursive copy: map illegal directory name chars

  copyin/copyout

  * don't unconditionally clobber
  * delete incomplete files after failed transfers
  * AppleSingle, Netatalk-/CAP-style AppleDouble?

Future wish-list:

  * support HFS+ (aka Sequoia, Extended Format)
  * partitioning utility
  * defragmenting utility

Acknowledged limitations:

  * null characters (ASCII 0x00) not supported in filenames
  * partition maps not managed with A/UX support

Quick instructions for installing:

1. Change to the minicom-1.82/src directory (where minicom-1.82 should be
   the directory where this file was unpacked)
2. make
3. make install    (this should be done as root, or if you are logged in as
		   somebody else, do "su -c 'make install'")
4. as root, do 'minicom -s' to enter the configuration mode. Check all the
   settings, change what should be changed on your system, and choose
   'Save setup as dfl' from the configuration menu to save the changed
   settings as system defaults.
   Edit /etc/minicom.users, adding the usernames which should be allowed
   to use minicom.

Now you should have minicom comiled, installed and ready to use.

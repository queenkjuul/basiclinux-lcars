              WHATS NEW IN Samba 2.0.3
              ========================

This is the latest stable release of Samba. This is the
version that all production Samba servers should be running
for all current bug-fixes.

New/Changed parameters in 2.0.3
-------------------------------

There are 2 new parameters and one enhanced parameter in
the smb.conf file.

The new parameters are :

nt acl support
--------------

This is a global parameter that defaults to False (at the
present time). If set to yes it allows UNIX file permissions
to be reported via the Windows NT "cacls.exe" program. As some
of the RPC calls that allow cacls to report the name of the
owner of a file are not yet implemented in 2.0.3 this parameter
is set to "no" by default. The default state of this parameter
will change to "yes" in a future release.

min passwd length
-----------------

This is an integer global parameter that tells Samba the minimum
permissible UNIX password length (in characters) when Samba is
set to synchronise the Windows and UNIX passwords. By default
this is set to 5, and was previously hardcoded into Samba 2.0.x.

The modified parameter is :

announce as
-----------

Prior to 2.0.3 this parameter had only one setting for Windows
NT compatibility, "NT", which was the default. This is still
the default and this still tells Samba to announce itself in
browse lists as an NT server, however this parameter may now
be set to "NT workstation" which causes Samba to announce itself
as an NT workstation instead of a server. 

All of these new parameters and changes are documented in the
smb.conf man pages and html pages.

Updated and New documentation
-----------------------------

The NT Domain FAQ has been updated. Three new text documents have
been provided :

docs/textdocs/File-Cacheing.txt
docs/textdocs/NT-Guest-Access.txt
docs/textdocs/CRLF-LF-Conversions.txt

Bugfixes added since 2.0.2
--------------------------

1). --with-ssl configure now include ssl include directory. Fix
from Richard Sharpe.
2). Patch for configure for glibc2.1 support (large files etc.).
3). Several bugfixes for smbclient tar mode from Bob Boehmer
(boehmer@worldnet.att.net) to fix smbclient aborting problems
when restoring tar files.
4). Some automount fixes for smbmount.
5). Attempt to fix the AIX 4.1.x/3.x problems where smbd runs as
root. As no-one has given us root access to such a server this
cannot be tested fully, but should work.
6). Crash bug fix in debug code where *real* uid rather than 
*effective* uid was being checked before attempting to rotate
log files. This fix should help a *lot* of people who were
reporting smbd aborting in the middle of a copy operation.
7). SIGALRM bugfix to ensure infinate file locks time out.
8). New code to implement NT ACL reporting for cacls.exe program.
9). UDP loopback socket rebind fix for Solaris.
10). Ensure all UNICODE strings are correctly in little-endian
format.
11). smbpasswd file locking fix.
12). Fixes for strncpy problems with glibc2.1.
13). Ensure smbd correctly reports major and minor version number
and server type when queried via NT rpc calls.
14). Bugfix for short mangled names not being pulled off the
mangled stack correctly.
15). Fix for mapping of rwx bits being incorrectly overwritten
when doing ATTRIB.EXE
16). Fix for returning multiple PDU packets in NT rpc code. Should
allow multiple shares to be returned correctly).
17). Improved mapping of NT open access requests into UNIX open
modes.
18). Fix for copying files from an NTFS volume that contain
multiple data forks. Added 'magic' error code NT needs.
19). Fixed crash bug when primary NT authentication server
is down, rolls over to secondaries correctly now.
20). Fixed timeout processing to be timer based. Now will
always occur even if smbd is under load.
21). Fixed signed/unsigned problem in quotas code.
22). Fixed bug where setting the password of a completely fresh
user would end up setting the account disabled flag.
23). Improved user logon messages to help admins having
trouble with user authentication.

Bugfixes added since 2.0.1
--------------------------

Note that due to a critical signal handling bug in 2.0.1,
this release has been removed and replaced immediately with 
2.0.2. The Samba Team would like to apologise for any problem
this may have caused.

1). Fixed smbd looping on SIGCLD problem. This was
    caused by a missing break statement in a critical
    piece of code.

Bugfixes added since 2.0.0
--------------------------

1). Autoconf changes for gcc2.7.x and Solaris 2.5/2.6
2). Autoconf changes to help HPUX configure correctly.
3). Autoconf changes to allow lock directory to be set.
4). Client fix to allow port to be set.
5). clitar fix to send debug messages to stderr.
6). smbmount race condition fix.
7). Fix for bug where trying to browse large numbers of shares
    generated an error from an NT client.
8). Wrapper for setgroups for SunOS 4.x
9). Fix for directory deleting failing from multiuser NT.
10). Fix for crash bug if bitmap was full.
11). Fix for Linux genrand where /dev/random could cause 
     clients to timeout on connect if the entropy pool was
     empty.
12). The default PASSWD_CHAT may now be overridden in local.h
13). HPUX printing fixes for default programs.
14). Reverted (erroneous) code in MACHINE.SID generation that
     was setting the sid to 0x21 - should be *decimal* 21.
15). Fix for printing to remote machine under SVR4.
16). Fix for chgpasswd wait being interrupted with EINTR.
17). Fix for disk free routine. NT and Win98 now correctly
     show greater than 2GB disks.
18). Fix for crash bug in stat cache statistics printing.
19). Fix for filenames ending in .~xx.
20). Fix for access check code wait being interrupted with EINTR.
21). Fix for password changes from "invalid password" to a valid
     one setting the account disabled bit.
22). Fix for smbd crash bug in SMBreadraw cache prime code.
23). Fix for overly zealous lock range overflow reporting.
24). Fix for large disk disk free reporting (NT SMB code).
25). Fix for NT failing to truncate files correctly.
26). Fix for smbd crash bug with SMBcancel calls.
27). Additional -T flag to nmblookup to do reverse DNS on addresses.
28). SWAT fix to start/stop smbd/nmbd correctly.

Major changes in Samba 2.0
--------------------------

This is a MAJOR new release of Samba, the UNIX based SMB/CIFS file 
and print server for Windows systems.

There have been many changes in Samba since the last major release,
1.9.18.  These have mainly been in the areas of performance and
SMB protocol correctness.  In addition, a Web based GUI interface
for configuring Samba has been added.

In addition, Samba has been re-written to help portability to
other POSIX-based systems, based on the GNU autoconf tool.

There are many major changes in Samba for version 2.0.  Here are 
some of them:

=====================================================================

1). Speed
---------

Samba has been benchmarked on high-end UNIX hardware as out-performing
all other SMB/CIFS servers using the Ziff-Davis NetBench benchmark.
Many changes to the code to optimise high-end performance have been made.

2). Correctness
---------------

Samba now supports the Windows NT specific SMB requests.  This
means that on platforms that are capable Samba now presents a
64 bit view of the filesystem to Windows NT clients and is
capable of handling very large files.

3). Portability
---------------

Samba is now self-configuring using GNU autoconf, removing
the need for people installing Samba to have to hand configure
Makefiles, as was needed in previous versions.

You now configure Samba by running "./configure" then "make".  See
docs/textdocs/UNIX_INSTALL.txt for details.

4). Web based GUI configuration
-------------------------------

Samba now comes with SWAT, a web based GUI config system.  See
the swat man page for details on how to set it up.

5). Cross protocol data integrity
---------------------------------

An open function interface has been defined to allow 
"opportunistic locks" (oplocks for short) granted by Samba
to be seen by other UNIX processes.  This allows complete
cross protocol (NFS and SMB) data integrety using Samba
with platforms that support this feature.

6). Domain client capability
----------------------------

Samba is now capable of using a Windows NT PDC for user
authentication in exactly the same way that a Windows NT
workstation does, i.e. it can be a member of a Domain.  See
docs/textdocs/DOMAIN_MEMBER.txt for details.

7). Documentation Updates
-------------------------

All the reference parts of the Samba documentation (the
manual pages) have been updated and converted to a document
format that allows automatic generation of HTML, SGML, and
text formats.  These documents now ship as standard in HTML
and manpage format.

=====================================================================

NOTE - Some important option defaults changed
---------------------------------------------

Several parameters have changed their default values.  The most
important of these is that the default security mode is now user
level security rather than share level security.

This (incompatible) change was made to ease new Samba installs
as user level security is easier to use for Windows 95/98 and
Windows NT clients.

********IMPORTANT NOTE****************

If you have no "security=" line in the [global] section of 
your current smb.conf and you update to Samba 2.0 you will
need to add the line :

security=share

to get exactly the same behaviour with Samba 2.0 as you
did with previous versions of Samba.

********END IMPORTANT NOTE*************

In addition, Samba now defaults to case sensitivity options that
match a Windows NT server precisely, that is, case insensitive 
but case preserving.

The default format of the smbpasswd file has also been
changed for this release, although the new tools will read
and write the old format, for backwards compatibility.

=====================================================================

NOTE - Primary Domain Controller Functionality
----------------------------------------------

This version of Samba contains code that correctly implements
the undocumented Primary Domain Controller authentication
protocols.  However, there is much more to being a Primary
Domain Controller than serving Windows NT logon requests.

A useful version of a Primary Domain Controller contains
many remote procedure calls to do things like enumerate users, 
groups, and security information, only some of which Samba currently
implements. In addition, there are outstanding (known) bugs with
using Samba as a PDC in this release that the Samba Team are actively
working on. For this reason we have chosen not to advertise and 
actively support Primary Domain Controller functionality with this
release.

This work is being done in the CVS (developer) versions of Samba,
development of which continues at a fast pace.  If you are
interested in participating in or helping with this development
please join the Samba-NTDOM mailing list.  Details on joining

.TH SMBMOUNT 8 "28 Feb 1999" "smbmount 2.0.3"
.SH NAME
smbmount \- mount smb file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smbmount
[
.B options
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B smbmount 
is a stripped-down version of the 
.BI smbclient (1)
program used to mount smbfs shares. It implements only the mount command,
which then calls the
.BI smbmnt (8)
program to do the actual mount.
.B smbmount
itself accepts most of the options that
.B smbclient
does. See the
.BI smbclient (1)
manpage for details.

To mount an smb file system, I suggest using the option
.B -c
for smbmount to pass the mount command. For example, use

smbmount "\\\\server\\tmp" -c 'mount /mnt -u 123 -g 456'

to mount the tmp share of server on /mnt, giving it a local uid 123
and a local gid 456.

The arguments supplied to the mount command are passed directly to the
.B smbmnt
utility for processing.
Refer to the
.BI smbmnt (8)
manpage for details.

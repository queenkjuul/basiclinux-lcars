   ziptool will turn write-protection on and off for ZIP disks including
   those that have been write-protected with a password. It can also
   eject the disk in your ZIP drive.

   The ziptool program requires read/write access to the physical disk
   device, so it can only be run by root. It does not require any special
   kernel patches, and it works with both the SCSI and PPA versions of
   the drive. It makes a number of sanity checks to ensure that you don't
   attempt to manipulate a mounted disk, and that you are actually
   operating on a ZIP disk.

   Not all protection modes supported by the hardware are available in
   Linux. In particular, there is a mode that prevents all access to the
   device until it is unlocked with a password. This mode is not
   supported, as Linux is unable to open such a disk anyway.

ZipTool commands

   Ziptool's command syntax takes the form:
        ziptool device command

   Where device is the full device name for the raw SCSI device
   corresponding to your ZIP drive, for example: /dev/sda, and command is
   one of the following: eject, ro, rw or status.

   eject ejects the disk from your ZIP drive. ro puts the disk in the
   drive into read-only mode, the new mode is recorded on the disk volume
   and remains in effect for that volume until the rw command is used to
   change it. You can also change it with Iomega's own ZipTools programs
   under DOS or Windows, of course.

   rw restores read-write permissions on the current disk volume. If the
   disk has been protected with a password, you will be prompted to enter
   that password before writing is enabled. You can use the status
   command to determine the current write-protection mode of the disk.

   Whenever you change the mode on a disk, ziptool will eject the disk.
   This behaviour is necessary to ensure that Linux rereads the
   write-protect flag for the disk before attempting to use it again.

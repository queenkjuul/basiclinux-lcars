 	        Building and Installation of TkDesk 1.0


This file describes how to compile and install the source release of
TkDesk.  Linux users may find precompiled dynamic or static (not
requiring Tcl/Tk) binaries at the TkDesk homepage:
http://people.mainz.netsurf.de/~/bolik/tkdesk/


Requirements
------------

If you have to (or want to) compile TkDesk yourself, you'll need either
Tcl/Tk 7.5/4.1 , or better 7.6/4.2 installed on your system.  Tcl/Tk 8.0
is not supported yet.  It will be once [incr Tcl] supports it.

If you don't have the right version of Tcl/Tk installed yet you can get
it from ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl or any mirror site.  The files to
download are tcl7.6p2.tar.gz and tk4.2p2.tar.gz.


Compilation
-----------

To compile TkDesk you first have to create the Makefiles for your system
by running "./configure".  If you don't want to install TkDesk underneath
/usr/local, which is the default, do "./configure --prefix=<path>".

When configure exits (successfully), run "make".

If you get an error message saying that "ranlib" could not be found:
This error is ignored by make, and you can safely do the same. Some
systems require archives to be ranlib'ed, others don't.

Linux RedHat users:
There may be a missing symbolic link that you have to create yourself
to link TkDesk.  This is the procedure suggested by David Scott:

   1) Make sure you have /lib/libdl.so.1
   2) Run /sbin/ldconfig
   3) cd /lib
   4) ln -s libdl.so.1 libdl.so
   5) Try compiling again (I think it worked for me!)


Test Drive
----------

If you'd like to have a look at TkDesk when make is finished but
before installing it, do the following:

   1) Comment out the 6th line in the file tkdesk, that's the one
      beginning with "set tkdesk(library) ..." by putting a "#" in
      the first column.
   2) Start tkdesk with the command "./tkdesksh tkdesk -default"

   
Installation
------------

Just issue the command "make install" to install the TkDesk binaries and
scripts, the Tcl library, and the manual pages. Note that you may have
to become the root user first to gain write access to the installation
directories.

And that's it! You now should be able to start TkDesk from the command
line by typing "tkdesk".  The principal rule then is to click on
everything with all your mouse buttons (not always simultaneously though :-)).


Where To Go From Here
---------------------

Since 1.0b4 there is a short "Quick Start Guide" available that's
automatically displayed when TkDesk is run for the first time.
It's also available from the browser window's "Help" menu.
Please read it, it's *really* short!

The TkDesk User's Guide is available both as PostScript in the "doc"
subdirectory (of the directory created when you untar'ed the TkDesk
package), as well as online via the help button of the application bar
or the "Help" menu.  Unfortunately, it's seriously out of date.
Hopefully there will be an updated version for TkDesk 1.0.

I hope you enjoy TkDesk! If you have any suggestions for the further 
development of TkDesk, or in the unlikely event of finding a bug, or fancy
helping with the further development of TkDesk, please send me an email to 
Christian.Bolik@mainz.netsurf.de. I'd also appreciate it if you just told
me what you think about TkDesk in general.  Oh yes, and donations are of
course always welcome! :-)

Have fun!

     Christian

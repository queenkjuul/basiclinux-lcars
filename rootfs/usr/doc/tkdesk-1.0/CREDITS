(Note: I shamelessly cut and pasted this from Linus Torvalds' CREDITS
file that he distributes with the Linux sources.  I just thought the format
looks pretty useful.)

	This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
	contributed to the TkDesk project.  It is sorted by name, and
	formatted in a format that allows for easy grepping and
	beautification by scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E),
	web-address (W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D)
	and snail-mail address (S).

	I apologize in advance to everybody I forgot to put on this list
	(and I'm sure I forgot at least seom of you).  I'd appreciate it
	if you sent me a short mail to refresh my memory so I can get
	this list a little more complete.
	
	Thanks,
			Christian

For all:
	I cannot check if the nice feature
	that shows the time left until the total
	discharge works properly because it is
	not supported by my apmd. 
	Let me know if something goes wrong.

For FreeBSD users:
	I cannot check if all the features
	work correctly. All I 've got is Linux.
	Let me know if something goes wrong.

About reactions to power events:
	You can execute lots of stuff in asapm as
	reactions to the APM events. Try not to 
	exaggerate. For example, you can run hdparm
	utility but read the documentation - there
	is a danger of wiping your disk if you 
	specify incorrect parameters!
	I implemented just a few possible reactions
	out of many. I only needed to suspend my
	computer when the power goes too low (I
	happened to leave my computer running on
	the battery and go to sleep :-( already)
	so consider I overdid what I wanted. If you
	feel inclined you can extend the reactions
	almost endlessly.

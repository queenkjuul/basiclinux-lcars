In response to several requests (see e.g. the `LinuxThreads and
XFree86-3.3' subject), I have made the following available:

ftp://ftp.dent.med.uni-muenchen.de/pub/wmglo/XFree86-3.3-libs.README
ftp://ftp.dent.med.uni-muenchen.de/pub/wmglo/XFree86-3.3-libs.tar.gz

If you want to perform X calls from multiple threads concurrently,
these libraries are _not_ for you.  In that case, please consider
switching to glibc-2.0 and using the XFree86-3.3 binaries for that
configuration.  However, if all you need is X11 libraries that can be
used with LinuxThreads, for applications that make X calls from one
thread at a time only, these libraries should work.  (They work fine
for me, but of course I cannot make any guarantees.)  They are also
completely backward compatible in my experience, i.e. all applications
linked against the standard versions of the libraries should work just
fine.

These are all the libraries installed by XFree86-3.3, compiled on a
i586-linux2.0.30 system, using the following tools:

o GNU binutils-2.8.1.0.1
o GNU gcc-2.7.2.1 (standard, no pentium optimization) with '-m486
  -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -O2'
o Linux libc-5.4.23

They have been compiled with the standard options, except putting
`-D_REENTRANT' next to `-D_POSIX_SOURCE' in linux.cf.

Regards,
Wolfram.

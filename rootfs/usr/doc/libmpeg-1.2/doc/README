This directory contains the documentation for the MPEG Library.
Please note that this is the first version of the document; if
anything is unclear (or incorrect!), please tell me about it and I'll
see if I can clarify or correct.

The document is supplied as LaTeX2e source, along with the
corresponding dvi and PostScript output.  The PostScript file should
work with most PostScript printers or Ghostscript; however, the
document uses PostScript fonts rather than LaTeX fonts, so if
you have problems you might want to remove the "\usepackage{palatino}"
line from the LaTeX file and rerun LaTeX.  Note that you will need
LaTeX2e and the psfig package.

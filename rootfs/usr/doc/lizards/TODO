version 1.2

Still need to add a nice front end. Better levels are on the way. There are
15 in this version. Better samples could be called for. Don't need to speed
it up, though!

version 1.3

Slight bug in level 2 fixed
640x480x256 version running and in this distribution. Do I *really* need to
do a front end? Would anyone like me to do Gauntlet instead?

version 1.4
640x480x256 only version in distribution. Front end up and running, with
builtin level editor. Provided levels aren't up to much - I'm hoping you lot
can help here :)

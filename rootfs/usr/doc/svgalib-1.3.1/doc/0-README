Apart from a few readme's, this directory contains all man pages for svgalib.

I case you want to see one prior to installing svgalib, you can use

man -M. manpage

to see the page if you man binary supports it. If not, and if you have
nroff or groff the tman script in this directy can be used as:

tman manpage

tman will have problems with the compressed files. However, the error
message will indicate at which manual page you should look instead.

Finally,

make ascii
make lpr
make dvi
make ps

will produce documentation files in these format for nice printouts in
this directory. 'ascii' is an Ascii file to be viewed on a terminal.
'lpr' is an ascii file too, but will contain <Backspace> characters
to emulate bold and underlined on a line printer.

make clean

will remove these files again.

The file ../0-README is actually an ascii printout of svgalib.7

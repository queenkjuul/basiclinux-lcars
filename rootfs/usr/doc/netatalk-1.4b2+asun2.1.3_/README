netatalk is an implementation of the AppleTalk Protocol Suite.  The
current release contains support for EtherTalk Phase I and II, DDP,
RTMP, NBP, ZIP, AEP, ATP, PAP, ASP, and AFP.  The complete stack looks
like this on a BSD-derived system:

    AFP
     |
    ASP    PAP
      \   /
       ATP RTMP NBP ZIP AEP
	|    |   |   |   |
   -+---------------------------------------------------+- (kernel boundary)
    |                    Socket                         |
    +-----------------------+------------+--------------+
    |                       |     TCP    |    UDP       |
    |          DDP          +------------+--------------+
    |                       |           IP              |

DDP is in the kernel.  "atalkd" implements RTMP, NBP, ZIP, and AEP.  It
is the AppleTalk equivalent of Unix "routed".  There is also a
client-stub library for NBP.  ATP and ASP are implemented as
libraries.  "papd" allows Macs to spool to "lpd", and "pap" allows Unix
machines to print to AppleTalk connected printers.  "psf" is a
PostScript printer filter for "lpd", designed to use "pap".  "psorder"
is a PostScript reverser, called by "psf" to reverse pages printed to
face-up stacking printers.  "afpd" provides Macs with an interface to
the Unix file system.  Refer to the appropriate man pages for
operational information.

netatalk runs on five operating systems:

	OS	Versions	Hardware	Notes
	--	--------	--------	-----
	Solaris	2.5		Sparc
	Linux	1.3.x,2.x	PC
	FreeBSD	2.2-current	PC		after 12 Sept 96
	SunOS	4.1+		Sparc		kernel must have VDDRV
						option installed
	Ultrix	4.[1-4]		3100,5000

Instructions for installing the kernel portions of netatalk and system
dependent FAQs are in the README file for your system, e.g.
INSTALL/README.SUNOS, INSTALL/README.ULTRIX.

Building netatalk:

0.  To build afpd for use with an AFS filesystem, first follow the
    instructions in INSTALL/README.AFS, then complete these
    instructions.

1.  Set DESTDIR in the root Makefile.  DESTDIR is the directory below
    which all binaries will be installed.  Setting it causes all
    installation-relative pathnames to be set correctly.  You may also
    wish to set MANDIR.  (If you do not want all binaries to go under
    DESTDIR, you can instead set SBINDIR, BINDIR, ETCDIR, and LIBDIR,
    to control the locations of the individual sections.)

2.  When you've completed the configuration, type "make" at the root of
    the source.  This will make all binaries.

Installing netatalk:

1.  To install the binaries, type "make install" at the root of the
    source tree.  This will install all of the binaries.

2.  Sample config files for the daemons are in the config directory,
    e.g. config/AppleVolumes.system.  Install these files, or a version
    of these files, in ETCDIR (as distributed DESTDIR/etc), e.g.
    ETCDIR/AppleVolumes.system.  See the daemon's man page for a
    description of it's configuration file.

3.  psf uses the script SBINDIR/etc2ps to convert anything it
    doesn't understand to PostScript.  If you have a troff or dvi to
    PostScript filter on your machine, you might wish to edit etc2ps,
    to use your locally installed PostScript utilities.

4.  Add the contents of services.atalk to your /etc/services database.
    If you're using NIS (YP), add the contents of services.atalk to the
    NIS master's maps and push them.

5.  The file rc.atalk is installed in ETCDIR.  It should be called
    from your /etc/rc file, e.g. "sh ETCDIR/rc.atalk".  For more
    information on what this script does, read the man pages for the
    appropriate commands.

	This is the new version (1.14) of the second extended file system
management programs.

	From time to time, I release new versions of e2fsprogs, to fix
bugs and to make the utilities more robust.  You can always find
information about the latest version at the the e2fsprogs web page,
which is:

	http://web.mit.edu/tytso/www/linux/e2fsprogs.html

	Note: If you are using the RedHat RPM distributions of
e2fsprogs, don't worry about the next paragraph; all others, please
read on!

	See the file INSTALL for instructions on building and
installing e2fsprogs.  This is important!  Note that your /etc/fstab
file may need modifying before you install the new fsck program.  See
the INSTALL file for more details.

	In case of bugs in these programs, please contact Ted Ts'o
<tytso@mit.edu>.  See the e2fsck man page for suggestions of what sort
of information to include when submitting bug reports for e2fsck.

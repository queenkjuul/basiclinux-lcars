Rudelsberg is a Type 1 PostScript font which will work with Adobe Type Manager version 1.2 or higher and will print with hints on any PostScript printer.  The font is in the Art Nouveau vein (turn of the century Germany in this case) and may be thought of as a second cousin to Adobe's Arnold Boecklin font, in that the lower case letters are a little similar, although the upper case characters lack the swashes of Adobe's font.

Rudelsberg contains the full set of upper- and lower-case characters, numbers, and some punctuation, but no diacritics (I don't do windows either).  It contains a generous set of kerning pairs, as well. In addition, an alternate shape for "s" appears in the option-s slot and optional shapes for upper-case characters V,T,I,D,H,J and X are available in the option-shift slots for the same characters.  On a 300-dpi PostScript output device I don't recommend sizes smaller than 12 points for Rudelsberg.

Tribeca is a Type 1 PostScript font containing a full character, number and punctuation character set.  There are no diacritical characters.  It is modeled on 'Newton Inline,' an Art Deco font used fairly often for titles on paperback editions of mysteries.  Since Tribeca is a type 1 PostScript font, it is compatible with Adobe Type Manager, version 1.2 or higher.  It is also extensively kerned.Here is how ATM displays Tribeca at 96 points:ÊThe lower-case character set is identical to the upper-case character set.To install Tribeca, use the same remarkably convenient technique you use to install all your other PostScript fonts.  If you don't know how to install the font, go sit in a corner -- NOW -- and stay there.Tribeca -- the font -- is copyright © 1991 by David Rakowski, All Rights Reserved.

To show your appreciation, you might consider sending a postcard of your hometown to Victoria Salter, 703 Dodge Hall, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 USA, with the following message: "I didn't know where the wallpaper paste was, so I used doughnuts.  Would it have been better if the coffee had used cat hair for garnish?  I suppose we'll never know, but I have to go to the bathroom now."Tribeca is another altruistic service to the really weird of us in the Macintosh community, from Bug-Bytes.

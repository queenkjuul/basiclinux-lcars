MAZAMA (Type 1) Version 1.0Mazama is a beautiful Type 1 (ATM-compatible) display typeface based on M.G.B. Patrician. This font has uppercase characters, numerals, and punctuation only. There are numerous alternate swash characters for most of the characters (several characters have two alternates). It was created entirely with Letraset’s FontStudio (beta version). Mazama includes a 24-point screenfont and the AFM file as well as this READ ME FIRST! document.ALTERNATE CHARACTERS------------------------------This font includes many alternate swash capitals, and since there is no lowercase character set, I used the lowercase equivalent for alternates. Example: Pressing “Shift-A” will get you the primary character, while simply pressing “a” will get you the alternate swash A. The only characters that do not have any alternates are C, O, and Q. Besides these alternates, several characters have a second alternate as follows:“A” second alternate, press “Shift-comma”“E” second alternate, press “[”“K” second alternate, press “shift-]”“L” second alternate, press “]”“M” second alternate, press “\”“N” second alternate, press “shift-\”“R” second alternate, press “shift-period”“S” second alternate, press “shift-[”“T” second alternate, press “`”“X” second alternate, press “shift-`”THIS FONT IS SHAREWARE !----------------------------I am asking only $25 for Mazama, with a free 10-day trial period to test it out and see if you like it.

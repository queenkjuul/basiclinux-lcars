Collection of Free ATM Fonts
----------------------------

This is a collection of 79 freely available fonts. All of them were found in
the CICA archives for Windows.

Some of them are missing special characters, some only contain capitals,
some contain special alphabets. Be careful and check!

The collection was motivated by the lack of good fonts for Linux especially X11
and ghostscript. Scaled bitmaps look really ugly!

Installation for X11
--------------------

1. Change to /usr/X11/lib/fonts

2. untar the archive freefont-0.10.tar.gz

3. Give the following commands to make X11 accept the new fonts

  xset fp+ /usr/X11/lib/fonts/freefont
  xset fp rehash

4. The fonts are available under X11.
Check them out by running "xfontsel" for example.

5. Cleanup. You might erase all licenses in
/usr/X11/lib/fonts/freefont with
   rm *.license *.tgz
but it would be better to have a look at them first...

Installation for Ghostscript
----------------------------
1. Change to /usr/lib/ghostscript

2. Save the file "Fontmap"
e.g.
   cp Fontmap Fontmap.old

3. copy the new Fontmap from the archive.
If you have installed it already in X11 do
   cp /usr/X11/lib/fonts/freefont/Fontmap .

4. Copy necessary fonts to the ghostscript font directory
   (or use links.)

   cp /usr/X11/lib/fonts/freefont/tempo*pfb font
   cp /usr/X11/lib/fonts/freefont/baskvl*pfb font

5. Try it out. Groff -Tps should now produce better loocking documents although
the fonts do not exactly fit. You might want to tune some more. Replace some
more fonts with Type 1 ones to get a better output.

If you have any corrections please tell me! Especially if I missed the
copyright on one. Some fonts I found did not have a discernable copyright
and I assumed that it was ok to distribute them.

I have included the licenses/instructions with each font.
read <font>.license to find out more about a font.

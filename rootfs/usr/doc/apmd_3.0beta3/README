This is a completely re-written apmd for Linux.  It will work with 1.3.58
kernels, which have a new format for /proc/apm, and with older kernels.  I
have severely limited time to work on APM -- please do *NOT* send me mail
about how to use these utilities with older kernels.  If you want to use
these utilities with a production kernel, please wait until 2.0.x comes out
-- since we are in a code freeze, it is only a waste of time to
use these utilities or the APM patches with 1.2.x.

If you have bug reports, please include patches which fix them -- chances
are that I will not be able to produce your specific bug on my system.

apm is a stand-alone utility which prints the /proc/apm information in a
nice format.

xapmd is a little X utility that provides a bar graph of the battery
status.

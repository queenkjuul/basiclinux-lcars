Version 2.0.13

* png updated to 1.0.96

Version 2.0.12

* pbm, pgm, ppm, pnm updated to netpbm 1 March 94.
* Now all netpbm programs are included!
* pngtopnm/pnmtopng added.
* Modified to build under bash-2.0.
* Modified to build under glibc-2.0 (linux).
	
Version 2.0.9

* jpeg-v6a
* libpng is installed as 1.0.89, the previous 1.0.2 was a mistake.  Sorry.

Version 2.0.8

* zlib update to 1.0.2
* png updated to 0.89c
* added -D_BSD_SOURCE for linux to be compatible with XFree86 (this
  solves a problem first noticed with xemacs-19.14 which uses
  -D_BSD_SOURCE because XFree86 does.  Maybe we should all drop
  this flag?  The problem is that setjump changes because of this 
  flag.)

==>> NOTE: the shared lib version numbers on zlib have gone down!
Sorry.  This will confuse ldconfig.  The easiest fix is to just remove
the old libs.  Better move them somewhere else or rename them just in
case you later find they're needed.

Version 2.0.5

* jpeg updated to v6
* new targets for installing some apps (only jpeg has apps so far)
* new targets for installing man pages

Version 2.0.3

* Makefiles are cleaned up.  Now archive libs are built without -fpic,
and both shared and archive libs are built with more optimization.

* Header files are also installed by make install.

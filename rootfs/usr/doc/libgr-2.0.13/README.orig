This package is:
 -    How to build a DLL jumptable version of some graphics libs

It is based on:
 -    Eric Youngdale's package of tools for building DLL libraries.

It contains:
 -    slightly modified sources of the original libraries. 
 -    A few scripts that can help rebuilding the library.

It was designed by:
 -    Rob Hooft (hooft@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE)

With help of:
 -    David Engel (david@ods.com), the original author of the JumpTables.
 -    H.J. Lu (hlu@eecs.wsu.edu), the maintainer of our GCC and libc.
 -    the DLL tools 2.8 package by Eric Youngdale.

To build the lib (you don't need to if you trust me):
 -    you need an installed 'tools' package.
 -    If you use any GCC older than 2.4.5, you need at least 20MB of 
      virtual memory. USE A SWAP PARTITION/FILE!
 -    Type './make.clean' (if needed).
 -    Type './make.shared' to make the shared lib.
 -    Type './make.clean' (you must!).
 -    Type './make.static' to make the static lib.

To install the lib:
 -    copy lib*.sa to /usr/lib
 -    copy lib*.a to /usr/lib
 -    copy libgr.so.1.3 to /lib
 -    either : '/etc/chlib /lib/libgr.so.1.3'
      or :     'ln -s /lib/libgr.so.1.3 /lib/libgr.so.1'
 -    create a directory /usr/include/gr
 -    copy the following files from there subdirs here to /usr/include/gr:
		jconfig.h jinclude.h jpegdata.h pbm.h pbmplus.h pgm.h pnm.h
		ppm.h rle.h rle_code.h rle_config.h rle_raw.h tiff.h tiffio.h

Warning:
 -   This is the fourth release of the DLL graphics lib. I gave up compatibility
     with the older non-dll versions. Be careful: only delete the old version
     0.2 when you are sure no programs are using it!
 -   You'll need a DLL libc.so.4.4.1 or newer to make use of the shared 
     library, otherwise many programs will probably just dump core to you....

ChangeLog:
 -   1.3 vs 1.2
       Updated to Tiff 3.3 beta, used tools 2.8
 -   1.2 vs 1.1
       Updated to JPEG 4, used tools 2.5.2
 -   1.1 vs 1.0
       New GCC + Libs, less bugs
 -   1.0 vs 0.2
       DLL
 -   0.2 vs 0.1
       Updated many lib sources

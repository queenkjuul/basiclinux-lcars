Internet Chess Servers
----------------------

Internet Chess Servers (ICS's) can usually be found on several of the machines
listed below.  Within each group the most popular sites are listed first.  If
you connect to a site and find very few people logged in, try another.

The number immediately after each name is the "port number."  If you are
connecting to the server using xboard, 5000 is the default port number.  If you
need to specify a different port number, do so with the -icsport option to
xboard.  The number in the second column is the numeric IP address, again
followed by the port number.  You can use the numeric IP address in place of
the name if your system has problems looking up the name.  Warning: the numeric
IP address for a name can change from time to time.

This program allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk,
or Iomega Jaz or Zip disk) to be ejected under software control. The
command can also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers and the
auto-eject feature supported by some devices.

It also works with floppy disk drives when running Linux on the
Sun/SPARC platform.

It is loosely based on the SunOS eject command.

Build it by running 'make', and then run 'make install' as root. Check
the make file to be sure it puts the binary and man page where you
want them.

If you have any problems or suggestions, drop me a line. I'm
particularly interested in hearing if it does or doesn't work with
media other than CD-ROM or when running Linux on non-Intel machines.

In future should look at using new ioctl functions in <linux/ucdrom.h>
once they are implemented by most kernel drivers. This should allow
doing such things as:
- locking/unlocking door
- opening/closing tray
- selecting speed
- displaying drive info

Look at internationalizaton of output messages. Giuseppe De Marco
<gdm@rebel.net> has sent me an Italian version of the docs and source
code, but I'd like to do it properly (probably using GNU gettext).

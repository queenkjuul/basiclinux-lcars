                       ABOUT THE TIX PROGRAMMING LIBRARY
                                       
   The Tix library is an extension to the Tk toolkit that contains over
   40 new widgets for Tk. Features include: 
   
   A LOT of new widgets:
          The Tix library has by far the greatest collection of widgets
          for programming with Tcl/Tk. Highlights include: Hierarchical
          Listbox, Directory List/Tree View, SpreadSheet, Tabular
          Listbox, ComboBox, Motif style FileSelectBox, MS Windows style
          FileSelectBox, PanedWindow, NoteBook, Spin Control widget ....
          and many more. With these new widgets, your applications will
          look great and interact with your users in intuitive ways.
          
   Rapid Prototyping New Widgets:
          Tix comes with a complete Object-Oriented framework for
          building new customed widgets using TCL exclusively. It
          typically reduces the efforts of developing a new widget by a
          factor of ten or more.
          
   XPM image suport:
          This allows you to display color icons in XPM format. Supports
          transparent background.
          
   Compound images:
          A new image type called "compound" allows youto glue together a
          bunch of bitmaps, images and text strings together to form a
          bigger image. Then you can use this image with widgets that
          support the -image option. For example, you can display a text
          string string together with a bitmap, at the same time, inside
          a TK button widget.
          
   Display Items and Display Styles:
          Display items and display styles make it possible to display
          visual information in many formats.
          
   Form geometry manager:
          Works similarly to the Motif Form widget. You can specify
          geometry constraints using attachment rules.
          
   Mwm window mamager support:
          With the tixMwm command, you can communicate with the Motif
          window manager "mwm"; you can add new items to the Motif system
          menu and change the window manager decorations.

      Tix was written by Ioi Lam (ioilam@yahoo.com). Ioi is no longer
      able to provide technical sopport for Tix due to his limited
      time and the fact that he has a job now. The Tix mailing list is
      probably the best place to ask question about Tix.

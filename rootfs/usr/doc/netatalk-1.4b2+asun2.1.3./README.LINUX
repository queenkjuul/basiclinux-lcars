This is the Linux README file for netatalk.

We no longer include linux kernel code with netatalk, since Linux now
includes AppleTalk support.

1.  UIO.H.  On older versions of Linux, you may need to make a link from
    /usr/include/sys/uio.h to ../linux/uio.h.  In particular, this file
    changed from linux 1.2.x to 1.3.x, so if, for instance, you've
    installed Slackware 3.0.0, and upgraded your kernel to 1.3.x,
    you'll need to fix this.

2.  MAKE CONFIG.  Configure your kernel with "make config".  Answer yes
    to "AppleTalk DDP" support.

3.  INSTALL KERNEL.  Make and install your kernel.  Be sure to update
    your boot blocks!

4.  If you are using libc.so.5, you will need to comment out the
    -lcrypt and the -lrpcsvc in sys/linux/Makefile. If you're using PAM, 
    make sure you declare -DUSE_PAM and have -lpam -ldl.  
 
5.  Quota support should work under linux now. If you're using glibc
    2.x or libc > 5.4.34, you can comment out the
    -DNEED_QUOTACTL_WRAPPER in sys/linux/Makefile.

6.  Linux 2.2.x provides the sendfile() call. This reduces overhead
    when sending/copying files. If you would like to enable this
    support, add -DSENDFILE_FLAVOR_LINUX to the DEFS line.

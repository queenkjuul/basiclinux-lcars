<h2><a name = DISCLAIMER>1) DISCLAIMER</a></h2>

<p>
I am not responsible for any damage to your hardware or software caused
by this program.  The use of the program can be dangerous.  If you don't
know what you are doing, don't do it.  I am also not responsible for
any misuse of the program by creating copies of CDs without permission.

<p><center>
<h2>USE IT AT OWN RISK !</h2>
</center><p>

<h2><a name = Introduction>2) Introduction/Whats New</a></h2>

<p>
X-CD-Roast is a full X based CD-Writer-Program, and it is the successor
of the <i>cdwtools-0.93</i>.  <font color=#ff0000>It is a frontend for some CD related programs
like <i>cdrecord-1.6.1</i> and <i>mkisofs-1.12b4</i>. </font> With some simple mouse-clicks
you can copy or create your own CDs, without long study of any
commandline-parameters.

<p>
<b>Feature-list:</b>

<ul>
<li> Point'n'Click X11-Interface.
<li> Automatic SCSI- and IDE-Hardware Setup.
<li> Copies ISO9660-CDs, Non-ISO9660-CDs (like Mac- or Sun-CDs),
  Mixed-Mode-CDs and Audio-CDs.
<li> Master ISO9660-Data-CDs.
<li> Create your own Audio-CDs.
<li> Quick CD->CD Copy (no need of an image partition)
<li> Logfile
</ul>

<p>
<b>What is new with Version 0.96:</b>

<ul>
<li> Completely rewritten GUI.
<li> Supports commandline-switches. Start it with "xcdroast -?" to get an
     overview.
<li> IDE-Support for IDE-HDs and IDE-CD-ROMs (Audioread not yet supported).
<li> Displays an graphically overview of all SCSI- and IDE-Devices found.
<li> Up to 64 SCSI and 8 IDE Devices supported.
<li> Can read Audio now with all SCSI-CD-ROMs (hopefully).
<li> Won't need an extra image-partition anylonger - you can save your
     images anywhere on your system.
<li> Uses MSDOS-conform image- and audio-filenames. So you can mount your
     DOS-Partition and save your stuff there.
<li> Will now run even when no CD-ROM or CD-Writer is connected. Useful 
     when you only want to master something.
<font color=#007f00>
<li> Can safely be used by non-root users if started in nonroot-mode.
</font>
<font color=#ff0000>
<li> Supports most SCSI-CD-Writers and ATAPI-Writers. See <b>"README.ATAPI"</b> for more info.
</font>
<li> Hundreds of small improvements and fixes.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Stuff NOT working yet:</b>
<ul>
<li> Multisession not yet implemented (will follow soon).
<li> Bootable CD Creation not yet implemented (will also follow soon).
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name = Installation>5) Installation</a></h2>
Before you can use X-CD-Roast you have to compile it. Please study the
file "<b>README.Compile</b>" for instructions.
<p>
<font color=#007f00>
<b>Instructions for nonroot-mode:</b> <p>

Still logged in as root type <i>xcdroast -nonroot</i> to start the program for the 
first time 
(This assumes that /usr/local/bin is in your search-path - 
or whereever you installed X-CD-Roast). Then you should see a message that no
configuration-file was found.
Click on <b>Ok</b> to continue. Next read the disclaimer-warning and
click on <b>Setup</b> to do the initial setup.<p>
</font>

<em><font color=#007f00>
Note: Before this initial setup is done the program can't be used and non-root 
users are even not allowed to start it.</font></em><p>

<p>

<u>X-CD-Roast Commandline-switches:</u> <p>
-scanscsi <i>number</i>: 
<blockquote>
Defines for how much SCSI-Devices X-CD-Roast should scan. If set to 0, then
the SCSI-Bus won't be scanned at all. Maximum value is 64, but then you have
to take care yourself, that all Generic-SCSI-Devices exist in the i
/dev-directory. Default value is 16.
</blockquote>
-scanide <i>number</i>:
<blockquote>
Defines for how much IDE-Devices X-CD-Roast should scan. If set to 0 then
the IDE-Bus won't be scanned at all. Maximum value is 16, default is 8.
</blockquote>
-configdir <i>directory</i>:
<blockquote>
Set the directory where X-CD-Roast saves all
configuration-data. Default is ~/.xcdroast. <font color=#007f00>This
option can only be used by the super user in nonroot-mode.</font>
</blockquote>
-libdir <i>directory</i>:
<blockquote>
This is the directory where X-CD-Roast searches for its add-on
utilities and library-files. Default is
/usr/local/lib/xcdroast-0.96c. <font color=#007f00>This option can
only be used by the super user in nonroot-mode.</font>
</blockquote>
-display <i>host</i>:
<blockquote>
Display the X-CD-Roast-window on the X11-display of <i>host</i>.<br>
Note: This is equivalent with an "export DISPLAY=host" on the shell.
</blockquote>
<font color=#ff0000>
-nonroot:
<blockquote>
              Activate  the  "nonroot"-mode. This way only "root"
              can change any X-CD-Roast options  that  may  be  a
              security-problem. Every normal user can then use X-
              CD-Roast without any risk of causing  harm  to  the
              system.  (See "<b>README.nonroot</b>" for detailed info)
</blockquote>
-usecdparanoia:
<blockquote>
              Use a preinstalled CDParanoia 
              instead  of  the  built-in  readcdda. CDParanoia is
              able to read audio-data from lot more devices  than
              readcdda - therefore when you have problems to read
              audio-CDs try this option.  (See "<b>README.cdparanoia</b>"
              for detailed info)
</blockquote>
</font>

-debug <i>level</i>:
<blockquote>
Prints some debug-output to the console. The larger the level, the
more output will be generated. (e.g. -debug 2)
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2><a name = 1start>6) First start</a></h2>

<p>
You must be user "root" to run this program. Alternatively you can
do a <i>"chown root /usr/local/bin/xcdroast"</i> and <i>"chmod +s /usr/local/bin
/xcdroast"</i> as user root. Now all users can run xcdroast - Every user
will get an own config-file, but can also erase all your disks when picking
a wrong image-partition. On some systems you can't run mount, umount and some
other system-programs not as non-root. So when you have problems with the
automatic mount-code, its because you are not root. <b>SO BE CAREFULLY!</b> 
<p>
<font color=#007f00>
The other possibility is to use the nonroot-mode. In this mode only the
super-user can change security-relevant options and therefore no user
can damage the system. In nonroot-mode you also have to do the chown and
chmod as described in the paragraph above.
</font>
<p>
Type <i>xcdroast</i> to start the program (This assumes that /usr/local/bin 
is in your search-path - or whereever X-CD-Roast is installed)
Then you should see a message that no configuration-file was found.
Click on <b>Ok</b> to continue. Next read the disclaimer-warning and
click on <b>Setup</b>. <br>
You can also see if X-CD-Roast found all your hardware with the <b>SCSI/IDE-Info
</b>-Button.

<blockquote>
Note 1: If you can't start xcdroast, it is perhaps not in your path.
      Go into the directory where xcdroast is installed and type
      "./xcdroast" in this case.
</blockquote>
<font color=#007f00>
<blockquote>
Note 2: If instead of a window only an error message appears that root has 
      not configured the program yet, a super user has to configure it before 
      non-root users can start it.
</blockquote>
</font>
<blockquote>
Note 3: If you turn off the disclaimer-display by pressing the "Don't show again"-Button, you have to save your configuration in the Setup-Menu to make this permanent.
</blockquote> 
<hr>
<h2><a name = scsiinfo>7) SCSI/IDE-Info</a2></h2>
<p>
In this screen all SCSI- (up to 64) and IDE-Devices (up to 8) are displayed.
For SCSI you see an icon which expresses the device-type, its vendor and model-id and
the revision. In small print you see the SCSI-host, channel, id and lun.
For IDE you see also an icon, its id and the device (e.g. /dev/hda) it is 
assigned to. 
<p>
If you have more than 16 SCSI-Devices you can use the scrollbar to see more.
<p>

<hr>
<h2><a name = setup>8) Setup Menu</a></h2>

<p>
In the setup menu you specify all your hardware and choose the behaviour of
X-CD-Roast in some cases, all other
program modules will use the devices and settings you set here.

<ul>
<h3><li>CD-Setup:</h3>
  
  <p><dd>
  <b>CD-Writer Device</b>: This is your CD-Writer. You can here only choose
     from your SCSI-Devices type 4 and 5 (Worm and CD-Rom). Some CD-Writer
     identify themselves as CD-Roms, but please don't set a real CD-Rom as 
     write-device. 

  <p><dd>
  <b>CD-Writer Mode</b>: This is mode in which the writer is accessed. 
    You can choose here all different Driver-Types <font color=#ff0000>cdrecord-1.6.1</font> supports.
    Leave this option at "<b>Autodetect</b>". Autodetect will take care of ALL
    writers mentioned in the "supported CD-Writers-Section" and you should
    change this value only, when you have a writer cdrecord does not know
    about yet and you know which driver works with your writer. 

  <p><dd>
  <b>CD-Writer Speed</b>: This is the speed at which the data is written. 
    Don't specify a speed greater than the writer can handle. 
    For some writers it may be necessary to set to
    "Zero"-Speed. You have to experiment with that value when you have 
    problems.

  <p><dd>
  <b>Data-Read-Device</b>: This is the device that is used for all DATA-READ Operations
    on CD-ROMs. You can even specify your CD-Writer as Read Device. Here you 
    can choose from SCSI- and IDE-Devices. 

  <p><dd>
  <b>Audio-Read-Device</b>: Audio-Read is only supported for SCSI-Devices, so
   you cant specify an IDE-Device here. Its perfectly ok to select your
   CD-Writer as Read-Device and I also recommend this.  

  <p><dd>
  <b>Audio-Read-Mode</b>: Usually you should leave this setting at "Autodetect",
  but when X-CD-Roast says "Unsupported Device" when you try to read Audio-Tracks, you can try here some settings to find out if your SCSI-CD-Rom is compatible
  to a drive from another vendor. This is try and error, but you should get
  each CD-Rom-Drive to work with that. When your
  Audio-Read-Device is SCSI-3/mmc-compliant (most newer CD-Writers are), you
  should set this to <b>"SCSI-3/mmc"</b>. Autodetection won't work for these
  devices yet. <font color=#ff0000>If you have a ATAPI-CDROM you want to
  use to read audio-tracks set this to "<b>ATAPI</b>". If this still not works, try
  the CDParanoia-Mode.</font>

  <p><dd>
  <b>Audio Read-Back Speed</b>: This is the speed for reading audio data from 
    the CD-ROM. Data is read always at maximum speed.
    When you set this to "Default" then no speed-select command will be
    sent to the read-device. Experiment with the other settings to find
    out which speed works best for you.
    If you have a Philips CDD 2600 or a HP 6060i Writer you have to set
    this to 1x or 2x. <br>
    Please note that the speed select only works for
    CD-Writers! Most CD-Roms do not have a speed select and if they do, its
    done for each vendor differently. You can always use your writer for
    audio read, though. 

<p>
<h3><li>HD-Setup:</h3>

  <font color=#007f00><em>Nonroot-Mode Note:</em> This part only appears if you are
  logged in as 'root' because doing wrong things here can delete the whole
  hard disk. For non-root users these settings are overtaken from 'root's
  configuration.</font><p>

  Here you set which space on your harddisks X-CD-Roast may use to store
  CD-Images.<br>
  You can enter two different partitions (Partition 1 and Partition 2) which
  will totaly belong to X-CD-Roast. You can't use the partitions to store
  any data permanently because X-CD-Roast will overwrite them if requested.
  <br>Note: You have have to set one of the three blocks, but you are free
  to use all.
  <p>
  If you don't have a own partition (which should be about 800 MB in size)
  dedicated only for X-CD-Roast available, you can enter a <i>Image-Data-Path</i>. X-CD-Roast will save then all CD-Images and Audio-Tracks to that directory, 
  not disturbing other data that may be stored there. This is useful when
  you have lot of space on your HD left, but not in a own partition. You
  also can mount your DOS-Partition and let X-CD-Roast store its images there.
 
  <p><dd>
  <b>Image Partition</b>: This is the HD-Partition where CD-Images will be 
    stored. Should be about 800 MB in size when copying full CDs.

  <p><dd>
  <b>Image Mountpoint</b>: This is the mount point where the image partition
    will be mounted. This is needed when you copy the image to a file
    instead of copying it raw to a partition, or when copy Audio 
    or non-ISO9660-CDs.

  <p><dd>
  <b>Image-Data-Path</b>: A path pointing to a directory in that enough
    space for image-data is left. X-CD-Roast does not care where that 
    directory is...it can be on a mounted DOS-Partition or even on NFS 
    (but not recommended because slow).
  <p>
  In each block is a "Default"-Button. Here you can choose which Disk-Space
  X-CD-Roast will use as default. (You can change "on-the-fly" the partition
  or directory later - but here you set what is enabled first).
  <p>
  

<h3><li>Misc.:</h3>

  <p><dd>
  <b>DSP-Device for Audio</b>: This is your soundcard's dsp-device. You can use
    the soundcard to listen to audio-tracks.
    If don't have a soundcard that is able to play digital data at
    44.1 kHz, 16-bit, stereo, set this to <code>None</code>
    <br>
    Use the <i>Test</i>-Button to check if your soundcard works with X-CD-Roast.
    If you hear a "Gong"-Sound all works ok.

  <p><dd>
  <b>Beep via/when</b>: Here you can choose whether X-CD-Roast uses your Soundcard or
   your internal speaker when it wants to beep. <br>
   Here you set the events the program reacts to with a 
    beep. This can be used to get your attention when e.g. the CD is is
    finished.
    <p>
    There are four options:
    <ol>
     <li>Never: No beeps.
     <li> On Completion: Always when a read/verify/write operations is
     completed.
     <li> On Warnings: When a warning window pops up.
     <li> Always: On both events mentioned above.
    </ol>

  <p><dd>
  <b>Logfile</b>: Enter a filename in which all your actions will be
    logged. You also can disable logging.
    If enter a filename without a path (e.g. logfile.log instead of
    /tmp/logfile.log) then X-CD-Roast will save it in your
    config-directory (default: ~/.xcdroast). <font color=#007f00>If you
    try to put your log file into a non-existing directory or into a
    directory where you have no write permissions, the logging facility is
    turned off automatically</font>

  <p><dd>
  <b>Auto-Raise/Lower</b>: Here you set if X-CD-Roast should automatically
    iconify its windows on certain occasions.
    <p>
    There are three options:
    <ol>
     <li>Never: Never iconify or deiconfiy automatically.
     <li>Always: Everytime a new window pops up, iconify its parent
         window - this way you have always only ONE window of X-CD-Roast
         on screen.
     <li>Only on Read/Verify/Write: Only iconify the X-CD-Roast Master-window
         when a Read, Verify of Write-process is running. 
    </ol>

    <p><dd>
    <b>Save Window-Positions</b>: Here you set if X-CD-Roast should 
    remember the position of the Read/Write/Verify/Master-Process-Windows.
    <p>
    There are three options:
    <ol>
     <li>Never: Dont save the window-positions -> Display the windows
     centered relative to the main-X-CD-Roast-screen.
     <li>Save pos for all windows: Use the same screen-coordinates for 
     all the process-windows. e.g.: If you move a "Read-Image"-Window to
     a new screen-position, the "Write-Image"-Window will appear on the
     same position.
     <li>Own pos for each process-window: Save the coordinates for each
     process-window seperately. 
    </ol>

<p>
<h3><li>Defaults:</h3>
<p>
Here you set the default values for various different settings X-CD-Roast
may need later. All these values can changed later in there own context, but
here you set their startup values.

   <p><dd>
   <b>Default Write-Options</b>: These are covered in the <i>Write Image</i>
    Section later.
   <p><dd>
   <b>Default Subprocess-View</b>: Here you set the default behaviour of the
     Read, Verify and Write-Windows. You can choose how these windows are
     displayed and what kind of information is shown. 
   <p><dd>
   <b>Default Read-Audio-Opt.</b>: See <i>Read Audio</i> later.
   <p><dd>
   <b>Listen while recording:</b>: See <i>Read Audio</i> later. 
   <p><dd>
   <b>Default Time-Offset Unit</b>: See <i>Read Audio</i> later.

</ul>

<p>
After you have finished set up, press <b>Save</b> to create a configuration
file <i>xcdroast.conf</i>. Please note that your hardware settings, partitions 
and mount points are also saved in that file.

<p>
At each startup the settings in the file are compared to your current 
system settings and, if there are mismatches, you are forced to enter 
setup again.

<p>
Note: If you have been forced to enter setup, you can't access any of
X-CD-Roast functions until you completed successfully the setup. 
  
<hr>
<h2><a name = Copy-Data-CD>9) Copy-Data-CD</a></h2>

At startup you are in the <i>CD/Image-Info</i>-Subsection of the
Copy-Menu.
<p>
The setup of your devices is diplayed at the top of the menu. To change 
any of the values, you must enter the setup menu again.
But you can change your Image-Device on-the-fly when you set more than one
Image-Partiton/Path in the Setup-Menu. This way you can store more than
one Image at the same time.
<p>
You see a window titled <b>CD-Information</b> which identifies
the CD in the Data-Read device. The window <b>Image-Information</b> gives you 
information about the contents of the image partition.
<blockquote>
<br>Hint: When you double-click on an image-filename in the image-information
window or a data-track in the cd-information-window, you can look what files are stored in that image.
</blockquote>
<p>
The button <b>Eject CD</b> will try to eject the CD in the Data-Read-Device.
<p>
The button <b>Update Information-Windows</b> updates the two information windows. You should
press this button after inserting a new CD.

<p>
Copy a Data-CD in four steps: 
<ol>
<li><a href = #Read Image>Read Image</a>
<li><a href = #Verify Image>Verify Image</a>
<li><a href = #copywriteimage>Write Image</a>
<li><a href = #verifyburnimage>Verify Burned Image</a>
</ol>

<p>
First read the entire contents of the CD to a HD-Partition. Then
optionally verify the data by comparing the partition with the CD. Next
write the CD-image from the HD to a CD-Recordable. The last step is
the verification of burned CD-R with the image on the HD.

<dl>
<a name = Read Image><dt> <b>Read Image</b>:</a>

   <dd>
   <i>Diskspace needed for Image</i> displays the size of the image and <i>Diskspace available</i> shows 
   how much space is left on the image partition. 
   <i>Image-ISO9660-Label</i> displays the label of the CD in the CD-Rom-Drive.
   <p>
   Here, you can choose whether you want to read the image to a file or 
   raw to the partition. I recommended a read to the partition because
   this is a little bit faster. If you selected an "Image-Path" to save 
   the image, you can only read to a file. 

   <p>
   If you insert a non-ISO9660 CD (like Mac or Sun-CDs) you have to 
   read the image to file because this is only way to determine 
   the image size when writing.

   <blockquote>
   Note: If you read the image to a file, you can enter a filename. 
         Always make sure you have the extention ".raw". <font color=#007f00>
         It is not possible to write the file outside the "Image-Path", e. g. 
         on the system disk, so accidental deletion of system data, or 
         overfilling the system disk is impossible.</font>.
   </blockquote>

<a name = Verify Image><dt> <b>Verify Image</b>:</a>

   <dd>
   <i>Image-Size</i> displays the size of image on the CD.
   <i>Image-ISO9660-Label</i> displays the label of the CD in the CD-Rom-Drive.
   Verify always compares the CD in the drive with the image on the HD.

   <p>
   Note: You should not need to change any of the settings displayed
         in the verify-menu. They are correctly set when you enter
         the menu after reading the image.

   This writes the CD-Image from HD to a CD-Recordable.

   <p>
   You can specify the type of your CD-R and some write options:
   <ol>

   <li> <b>Simulation-Write</b>: Simulates the write-process. Your CD-R will
     not be written. Do this to test whether your system is fast enough
     to write without errors. 

   <li> <b>Eject After Write</b>: If you want to autoeject the CD-R after it has
     been written, enable this option.
   
   <li> <b>Pad Data-Track</b>: This add 30 kilobytes (15 sectors) of nulls to
     the end of each data track. This is a work-around for a bug in Linux
     (up to and including at least version 1.2.8), which sometimes does 
     not correctly read the last few sectors written. 
     Currently X-CD-Roast fixes the problem with disabling the read-
     ahead-cache of Linux when approaching the very last sectors of a
     CD.

<h2><a name = qkcp>10) Quick Copy-CD</a></h2>

<p>
<b>Quick Copy-CD</b> allows copying of a pure <b>ISO9660-Data-CD</b>
without the need of creating an image on HD.
<i>You need a seperate CD-ROM device</i> in addition to your writer to
utilize this feature. In this mode, data is read off the CD-ROM device
and written immediately to the writer.  Please note that your 
<i>read device should be faster than your writer</i> 
(alternatively, decrease write speed) - I recommend that the read device 
is twice as fast as the writer, but I successfully burned CDs with 
4.4x read speed and writing with 4x speed - and that any errors 
(e.g., read errors) result in a wasted CR-R! 

<pre><h3>		      USE THIS FEATURE WITH CAUTION !!!!!
</h3></pre>

I strongly recommend experimenting with this option only with 
simulation write enabled. The write options have been already explained
in the write-image section of this README file.

<h2><a name = copymx>11) Copy Audio-CD</a></h2>

<p>
Some notes about Audio-CDs:

<p>
Audio CDs are divided into tracks. Each track usually contains a song and,
between tracks, there is a two-second pause. Some CDs, however, do not have 
these two seconds pauses between tracks, which makes it tricky to copy them.
This software writes audio CDs in the <i>track-at-once-mode</i>, which 
means that the hardware (the writer) itself <b>ALWAYS</b> creates the
two-second pause. There is NO way to get around this at the moment. So, if you
want to copy a CD without the two-second pause, you have to read in the 
whole CD as ONE big track (see merging below). 
It is also not possible to set or read CD-indexes at present. 
This will change when cdrecord allows this.

<p>
Copying audio or mixed-mode is very similar to copying data CDs.
First read in the tracks (can be data or audio). Next verify
the tracks. Verification by comparison is only possible with data 
tracks. To verify audio tracks, you must listen to them (soundcard required).
Then you can write the CD. The last step is verification of the data track 
written on CD.

<ol>
<li> <b>Read Tracks</b>
   <br>
   <i>Tracks totals</i> shows how much tracks are on the CD in the Audio-Read-CD-Rom-drive. 
   <i>Total length</i> displays the total length of this CD.
   <i>Tracks selected</i> is how many tracks are selected to read. 
   <i>Selected length</i> is the length of all tracks selected to read.
   <i>Free Space</i> shows the free space on the image partition.

   <br>
   In the field <b>CD-Title</b> you can type the name of the CD. This name
   will be saved in the <i>audio-description</i> file and is only for your
   information.
   <b>Filename-prefix</b> is the prefix of the file name used for the track
   files.  A number and the extension <i>.cdr</i> (Audio)
   or <i>.raw</i> (Data) will be appended to this prefix.

   <p>
   When you press on the <i>Select/Show Tracks to Read</i>-Button a new
   window will pop up where you can choose or review which tracks will
   be read when you press on the <i>Start Read Tracks</i>-Button. 
   You can also select a Data-Track (e.g. when using a Mixed-Mode-CD) and
   it will also be read by your Audio-Read-CD-Rom-Device, NOT the Data-
   Read-CD-Rom-Device. (This means you dont have to switch disks when you 
   have choosen different read-devices in the setup).

   <p>
   <b>Options</b>: 
   <br>
   <i>Explaination</i>: Audio-Tracks have a beginning and an end.
   An offset is the relative time to the beginning or end.
   If you have a start offset of 1 sec. then the audio track will be
   recorded beginning 1 sec. after its real start. Negative values go
   back in time, and positive values go forward. 

   <blockquote>
   <b>Example</b>: If you have a track with 2 minutes and you want record
   only 30 sec. beginning after the first minute, you would enter
   a <i>start offset of 60 sec.</i> and an <i>end offset of -30 sec.</i>
   </blockquote>

   <p>
   <b>Global Offsets</b>:
   Global Offsets means that all tracks are assigned the same offset.

   <p>
   <b>Skip last 2 sec. of track:</b> Most audio CDs have a 2 sec. pause
   between the tracks. The CD-Writer automatically creates these 2 
   sec. pauses when writing audio tracks. 
   If you skip the 2 sec. pause at recording time,  you get the 
   2 sec. back when writing the track so the track retains its 
   original length.
   Nevertheless, I recommend listening to the track before burning
   the CD to make sure to complete song has been recorded. 
   <p>

   <b>Listen to audio while recording</b>: 
   When you read digital audio-tracks to
   disk you can listen to them at the same time. Note: If you enable this
   feature all audio-tracks will be read with single-speed. And you need
   to enable your soundcard in the "Misc.-Setup".

   <p>
   <b>Time-Offset Units</b>: Here you choose whether you want the offsets 
   displayed in seconds or in frames (1/75 sec.).

   <p>
   In the main-window you select which tracks you want to read.
   There you can enter a track title for audio tracks (for your 
   information only). The columns Preemphasis and Copy permitted show
   this information, you can't change them.

   <p>
   The playbuttons pre-play the audio-track exactly like they will be
   recorded. The play quality may be not very good. This depends on
   your hardware. You need a soundcard for this feature.
 
   <p>
   <b>Merging</b>:
   If you want record several tracks into one track, e.g., to get 
   around the automatic 2 sec. pause between tracks, you can merge tracks.
   Just select several tracks in order and click on "Merge Tracks".
   You will see a black arc connecting these tracks. Offsets between 
   connected tracks are ignored.
   A merged Track will contain more than one track of the original-CD, but
   will write as a single track (that is quite long) to a CD-R. The resulting
   CD-R will then have less tracks than the original CD, but the same play-
   lenght. You can't jump to the tracks you merged in, with your Audio-CD-Player track-
   selector.  

   <p> 
<li> <b>Verify Data-Track</b>
   <br>
   Compares the data track of the CD (Mixed-Mode only) with the
   data track file on HD.
<p>
<li> <b>Play Audio-Track</b>

   <br>
   Plays an audio track from the file on the image partition. With
   the info button you see all information stored to this track.

   <p>
   The play-audio window should be self-explanatory. Note that you
   can jump around in the track by left-clicking somewhere in the
   process display.
<p>
<li> <b>Delete Tracks</b>
   <br>
   Here you can delete some or all tracks from your hard drive.   
<p>
<li> <b>Write Tracks</b>
   <br>
   <i>Tracks on HD</i> displays how many data or audio tracks have been found
   on the image partition.
   <p>
   <i>Total length</i> shows the total length of all tracks on the HD.
   <p>
   <i>Tracks to write on CD</i> shows how many tracks are scheduled to write. 
   <i>Total CD-Size</i> shows how long the resulting CD will be. The 2 sec.
   pause between each track is already included.
   <p>
   The <i>Additional Options</i>-Box has already been explained in the 
   "Write Image"-Section, except the new Option "Swap Audio". "Swap Audio"
   will swap the byte-order of audio-tracks to write. Usually you won't
   need this option, but if you end up with an Audio-CD containing only
   static noise, you can fix that with that option. (And please drop me
   a note.) Remember, don`t touch this option until you really know
   you need it! Its not the same as the -swab option you might have needed
   when you have run cdrecord from command-line. X-CD-Roast tries to 
   do all necessary byte-order convertions automatically. 
   <font color=#ff0000> There is also a new option "Fix Wav-Files". This
   option pads wav-files you selected to burn to the correct length. Its
   save to enable this option in case you are not sure. </font>
   <p>
   After you pressed on <i>Select/Show Tracks to Write</i> you can choose
   which tracks you want to burn in which order to CD.
   <br>
   The window is tiled in two parts. The upper half shows all the tracks
   that are scheduled to write in their correct order. The lower half
   shows all available tracks found on HD, that are NOT yet scheduled
   to write. <br>
   Click on the <i>Order</i>-Button on an available track and it will show
   a number. The next track you click on will have higher number and so on.
   <br>
   When you click on <i>Refresh</i> all selected tracks will be moved to the
   upper half in the order you selected them. With the <i>Insert selected
   Tracks</i>-Combobox you can specify exactly where the tracks from the lower
   half will be included in the upper half. 
   <p>
   To deselect Tracks from writing click on its <i>Order</i>-Button so that
   the displayed number vanishes and click on <i>Refresh</i> again to see
   the new list.
   <p>
   In the Headline of this window you can choose <i>Save Track-list</i> which
   creates a textfile containing your actual track-selection.
   <p>
   If you are pleased with your selection you leave the window with <i>Done</i>
   and now you can click on <i>Start Write Tracks</i>.
<p>

<li> <b>Verify Burned Data-Track</b>

</ol>

<p>
Master a CD means that you setup a directory tree containing up to 650 MB
of data that is to be burned on a CD. Because the filesystem on a CD is
completely different from a filesystem on the harddrive, we must convert
the data to the CD-ROM format ISO9660. This takes quite some time. 

<ol>

<h3><a name = setmasdir><li> <b>Master from/to:</b></a></h3>
   Here you set where the data is you want to master. You can double-
   click on the directory-selection-window to browse through your file-tree.
   You also can enter the directory in the entry-box below. You have to
   press the <i>Return-Key</i> after you entered the path.
   <p>
   <b>Exclude paths</b>: Here you can enter some paths that will NOT be
    included in the CD-Image. Please note that you have to enter the
    full path to get this working. 
   <p>
   <b>Exclude globs</b>: Here you can enter simple regular-expressions 
    to remove some files from the CD-Image. (e.g. "*.o" will erase all files
    that end with ".o" from the directory-tree). The globs will be matched
    against all files and directories in the tree.
   <p>
   After you set all, the <i>Preview CD-Contents</i>-Button display the
   contents of the root-directory of the resulting CD. Note that this is 
   only a simulated output and may not 100% match the real burned CD.
   With the <i>Calculate Size</i>-Button X-CD-Roast tries to calculate 
   the exact size of the resulting Image. <br>
   <b>Note:</b> This also takes excluded paths and globs into account. 

<p>
<h3><a name = setimgtype><li> Set Image-Type:</a></h3>
   Here you define how the data should be mastered. This is done by
   setting the target system on which the CD will be used.
   <p>
   You can choose:          
   <ul>
      <li><b>Unix Rock-Ridge:</b>
          Use this for CDs with long filenames that are case sensitive, 
          links, permissions...
          This type of CD is perfect for Linux CDs and can be read by
          most other systems with a few drawbacks. Win95/NT ignores
          links and permissions. DOS has problems with long
          filenames.
      <li><b>Rock-Ridge + Win95/NT:</b>
          This is a good setting for most cases. It will create a 
          Rock-Ridge CD perfect for Unix-Systems, 
	  and due the Joliet-Support a very good 
          result on Win95/NT-Systems.
     <li><b>Win95/NT:</b>
	  This creates a true Joliet-CD for Win95/NT. This CD can only
	  be read on this systems or with Linux with the Joliet-patch.
	  DOS will only display short filenames.
     <li><b>DOS:</b>
	  Creates a CD with short filenames and no extras. Fully readable
	  on all systems.
     <li><b>Custom:</b>
	  <br>
          Define your own CD-Type:
          <ul>
	  <li><b> Include all files:</b>
             Don't skip files that contain a ~ or #. (Usually backup-files)
          <li><b> Follow symb. Links:</b>
             Follow symbolic links instead of writing them as link file
             in Rock Ridge or ignoring them otherwise.
          <li><b> Allow long (32-char) filenames:</b>
	     Use long filenames instead of the 8.3 format used on DOS.
	  <li><b> Enable Rock Ridge extensions:</b>
	     Use the Rock Ridge protocol to allow special files like 
	     links, devices and so on.
             This option will write all permissions and user and group-ids 
	     as they are in the filesystem. (Usually useless information for
             other systems)
	  <li><b> Rock Ridge with anonymity:</b>
	     Like the normal Rock Ridge, only that all user and group-ids
	     are set to 0. All permissions will be set in a way that is 
	     more useful (i.e., all files readable, none writeable, etc. )
	  <li><b> Create TRANS.TBL-files:</b>
	     Generates a file TRANS.TBL in each directory on the CD, which
	     can be used on non-Rock Rigde capable systems to help establish
	     the correct file names.
	  <li><b> Omit trailing periods:</b>
	     Omit trailing periods from files that do not have a period.
	     This violates the ISO9660 standard, use with caution.
	  <li><b> Do not use deep dir. relocation:</b>
 	     Do not use deep directory relocation, and instead just
	     pack them in a way we see them. This violates the ISO9660
	     standard, use with caution. This means that you can have 
             more than 8 directory levels even when not rock-ridge is used.
             (Works on Windows95/NT)

	  <li><b> Allow files beginning with a dot:</b>
	     Allow filenames to begin with a period. Usually, a 
	     leading dot is replaced with an underscore in order
	     to maintain MS-DOS compatibility.
	  <li><b> Omit ISO version numbers:</b>
	     Omit version numbers from ISO9660 filenames. This may
	     violate the ISO9660 standard, but no one really uses
	     the version numbers anyway. Use with caution.
	  <li><b> Enable Joliet extensions:</b>
	     Windows 95/NT introduced a new CD-format that allows
	     to put long filenames, deeper directory-levels and more
	     than one dot per filenames on a CD. This format is called
	     Joliet. It is possible to use Joliet at the same time as
 	     the Rock-Ridge extensions which do the same stuff for 
	     Unix-based operating systems. 	
	     </ul>
        </ul>
	<p>
	With the <i>Save as default</i>-Button you save your favourite
        setting. It will be automatically reloaded at the next start
        of X-CD-Roast.
       <p>

<h3><a name = setiso9660><li> <b>Set ISO9660 Header-Strings:</b></a></h3>
   Here we prepare the ISO9660-Header-Strings.
   <p>
    <ul>
    <li><b> Volume-ID:</b>
	Volume-ID to be written in the master block. DOS calls this
        disk label. 
    <li><b> Publisher-ID:</b>
        This should describe the publisher of the CD-ROM, usually with
	mailing address and phone number. Can be 128 chars long.
    <li><b> Preparer-ID:</b>
        This should describe the preparer of the CD-ROM, usually with
	mailing address and phone number. Can be 128 chars long.
    <li><b> Application-ID:</b>
	This should describe the application on the CD. Can be 128
	chars long.

   <p>
   <i>Read ID's from CD</i> reads all values from a CD in the Data-Read-Device.

    </ul>

<h3><a name = Master Image><li> <b>Master Image:</b></a></h3>
 
   Here you set where the image should be generated (just as with 
   "Read-Image"). 
   <p>
   With the <i>Calculate Size</i> button you can find out the exact 
   size of the image before you master it.
   <ul>
   <blockquote>
	Please note, that the given size also depends on the ISO-Settings
	like Rock-Rigde and follow Sym-Links. So set the image-type before
	you calculate the size, when you want a precise value. 
   </blockquote>
   </ul>

   <p>
   After mastering you can see into your image with the <i>Review
   Image-Contents</i>-Button to check
   whether the correct files
   have been mastered. The way filenames are displayed can differ a 
   little on other systems. 

<h3><a name = Write Image><li><b>Write Image:</b></a></h3>

<h3><li><a name = ISO9660notes>Some notes about the ISO9660-Filesystem:</a></h3>
 <p>
 Please consider that the ISO9660 standard does not allow more than 8
 directory levels. If you have more than that, a directory "RR_MOVED" will
 be created in the root of your CD containing all the files that are 
 beyond the eighth directory level. You can get around this limitation
 with the "Do not use deep dir. relocation"-Setting of the Image-Type.
 (Tested with Linux/Win95/NT)

 <p>
 If you enabled Rock-Ridge on the CD, then this directory will be invisible 
 mapped back at the correct position when you mount the CD on Rock-Ridge
 capable systems (Unix). 
 <p>
 When you see a directory "rr_moved" in the Image-Content preview window and
 Rock-Ridge was not enabled, you had more than 8 directory levels.
 <p>
 For full Windows 95/NT compatiblity you should enable Rock-Rigde and
 Joliet at the same time. This way both the Linux and Windows systems can
 use the CD as best as possible. 
</ol>

<hr>
<h2><a name = info>13) Useful Information</a></h2>

<p>
<b>READ THIS - It will help!</b>

<ol>
<li> Timing is critical while writing a CD. Be sure that nobody starts
  heavy-loaded processes. (Perhaps by shutting down the network.)
  You must maintain a steady data flow. If the CD-Writer "runs dry",
  the resulting disc may be unreadable. The more cache the CD-Writer
  has, the likelihood of missing data drops.
  <p>
  I was able to write a CD successfully with 4x-speed, on a Yahama Writer 
  with an ISA-Adaptec 1542B, 486/50. So there is enough
  power in Linux. Don't worry. But do use simulation writes to 
  play safe.

<li> The <b>Adaptec 2940-Series</b> is known to produce a lot of troubles with
  CD-Writers under Linux. Do enable Disconnect, reduce the SCSI-Transfer-
  Rate to a minimum for the Writer to prevent troubles. If everything
  else fails try to write with slower speed to see if the problem persists.
  Using the most recent driver for the Adaptec 
  solves a lot of problems. Go and install a new kernel! I have been
  told that you should let the driver-options at the default values! 
  Especially the "tagged command queueing" seems to cause lot of problems.

<li> For NCR-810 based controllers use the new NCR53C8XX-Driver and 
     enable async. mode if you have problems. 

<li> The next hints are taken from the <i>cdwrite</i> manpage:

       <p>
       Unless  your  SCSI  controller  and driver support discon-
       nect/reconnects, you will probably not be able to write  a
       CD  correctly  if  the  CD writer and hard disk are on the
       same SCSI bus.  It is not recommended that IDE drives  are
       used  on  CD-writing system; if they are, it is imperative
       that interruptible operation is enabled using  the  hdparm
       command.

       <p>
       It  is  not recommended to use more than single speed when
       reading data off a filesystem (as opposed to  a  raw  disk
       partition).

       <p>
       <i>cdwrite</i>  does  not  verify that the input data will fit on
       the media.  In the case of media  overrun,  the  resulting
       disc is usually unreadable.

       <p>
       A Compact Disc can have no more than 100 tracks.

       <p>
       When  creating  a disc with both audio and data tracks, it
       is conventional to place the data on  track  1.   Some  CD
       players  or  CD-ROM  drives may respond incorrectly to any
       other arrangement, although the specifications permit  it.

       <p>
       Many  systems are not able to read more than a single data
       track, or need special software to do so.

       <p>
       Some CD players have problems reading "gold"  CD's,  and
       some have problems reading the outermost tracks (i.e. very
       long CD's).

<li> I encountered a slightly unstable writing behavior when writing
  CDs with a lot of tracks. (Audio or Mixed-Mode). After I upgraded
  the firmware of my writer, it worked perfectly. ALWAYS use
  the simulation-write mode to check out whether your writer <-> SCSI 
  controller combination works stable.
  (You can also experiment with the SCSI-Setup in your SCSI-Bios...
   disabling disconnect may help.)

<li> Mounting an ISO-Image was dangerous with old kernels, if you use a 
  new kernel, you can do this. If you mastered a CD to a partition, 
  just mount this partition, if you created a image in a file, you 
  can use the new loopback mount to mount it.

<li> When you read digital audio tracks of a CD, check the quality of the 
  sound-files before you write them. Many CD-ROMs I tested support
  digital access to the tracks, but the resulting quality is noisy or 
  "scattered".
  <p>
  It is best to use your CD-Writer for audio read. They should all 
  perform perfectly.
 
<li> You can create your own audio tracks. Use the program "sox" (not 
  included) to convert any sound-format to the CDDA-Format. If you
  do that on a little-endian-machine like a 386/486/Pentium you have
  to reverse the byte order to big endian with the "-x" switch.
  X-CD-Roast now wants all its audio-tracks in big-endian-format, the 
  byteorder-handling is done internally in cdrecord.
 
  <p>
  Example: To convert a file "sound.wav" (44.1kHz, 16-bit, Stereo) to
  CDDA do this:
     <p>
     <b>sox sound.wav -x sound.cdr</b>

  <blockquote>
  Hint: After creating your own audio-tracks and copying them to the
    image directory, use the "Play Audio-Tracks"-Option to listen
    to your track. If it plays ok, you made everything right.
    (The audio-files must have a ".cdr"-extension to be recognized
     by X-CD-Roast)

   New: X-CD-Roast can now write wav files directly. Just copy
   the wav-files in the "Image-Data-Path" where X-CD-Roast looks
   for its tracks. You have to care yourself that the files are in
   44.1kHz, 16-Bit, stereo format! <font color=#ff0000>Be sure
   to enable the "Fix Wav-Files" Option in the Write-Tracks-Menu.</font>
   <li>
   If your Audio-Tracks are only noise after burning, then you got
   the endian-setting wrong. In this case you have to enable the
   "Swap Audio"-option in the "Write Tracks"-menu. 
    <li>If X-CD-Roast displays the track-sizes on a CD to large by a
    factor of 4, then you have perhaps jumpered your CD-Rom for 
    Unix-mode or you use a CD-Rom designed only for Unix-Workstations.
    The term "Unix" means here Unix-Hardware like Workstations from Sun or
    HP. Remove the "unix"-jumper on your CD-Rom to get the right sizes
    of your tracks.

<h2><a name = bugs>14) Known Bugs</a></h2>
<ol>

<li> I had some reports that mkisofs tend to core-dump when you use
     it on glibc-based systems (e.g. RedHat 5.0). In this case you have
     to upgrade your glibc. ftp.redhat.com offers a new version in its
     update directories. 

<li> When you start X-CD-Roast with a "-help" or "-h" Option you get
     an Seg. Fault. Use "--help" or "-?". Similar problem when you use
     "-display" to a host you cannot connect to. 
     This is a embedded Tix problem I don't know how to fix.

<li> Right now its not possible to write Mixed-Mode-CDs with a SONY-Writer.
     This is due a bug in cdrecord. The Author of cdrecord is working on
     that.

<li> If you have more than one SCSI-controller or you load/unload your
     SCSI-driver as a module, you might have problems with cdrecord
     finding your CD-Writer. In this case you have to install the
     Linux.scsi-patch which is in the cdrecord-source directory.

<li> When you abort a dummy-write with the "cancel"-button, you might
     end up with a CD-Writer in undefined state. If you are not able
     to remove the CD from the Writer you have to turn it off/on or
     in the worst case reboot your system. Especially the Philips 2600
     is known to refuse any further work until you turn in off/on. 
 
<li> When using the precompiled binary you get in some rare conditions 
     a "Tcl_CloseFile: unexpected file type, IOT trap/Abort"-Message.
     This results from some library incompatibilities and your system.
     You have to recompile the whole xcdroast to get it running.

<li> Sometimes the automatic mount or umount or formatting of a partition
     fails. Thats because on some systems you cant do that as non-root. 
     Not even the suid-bit helps in the case -> You have to run xcdroast
     as real root-user. (Does somebody knows how to get around that?)

<li> The Generic-SCSI-Interface of Linux is quite unstable. If you 
  experience a lock-up of X-CD-Roast when you start it up, or your SCSI-
  Devices are not anymore correctly identified, then you have to
  reboot your Computer.
  Some devices behave better than others... it also depends on your 
  controller. I hope somebody will reimplement the SCSI-Interface soon.

<li> Copying non-ISO9660 CDs is a little tricky. At the moment, I am 
  skipping the last two blocks of such a CD to ensure that I don't 
  reach an "unwritten" area, which can cause the kernel to crash.
  If you know a better way, I'd appreciate hearing from you.

<li> Sometimes the program freezes when trying to read from the CD-ROM or 
  writer when its tray is open. This looks like a hardware bug to me.
  If this happens, you have to restart the program.

<li> In some cases you can click on buttons, which should be "locked"  
  (when the watch mouse cursor is active). This is due the complex
  grabbing code in Tk and is a generally known problem. This behavior
  may be different in different Tk-versions.
 
<li> When you press on "cancel" while reading or verifying an image, you 
  have to wait some seconds until the button responds. This is because
  the program waits until the working process terminated.

<h2><a name = faq>15) Frequently Asked Questions and Problem-solver</a></h2>

<p>
Q: I am using the predecessor of this program, "cdwtools-0.93", what
   is new with X-CD-Roast?

<p>
A: Really new is the much easier to use X-Interface, the automatic
   SCSI setup, better audio-track control and a log facility.

<p>
-

<p>
Q: Is it safe to burn CDs under X?

<p>
A: Any 486 should be fast enough to handle this, but if you are in doubt
   try simulated writes to check if errors occur.
<p>
- 

<p>
Q: What about Multisession-support?

<p>
A: X-CD-Roast doesn't allow Multisession yet. If you need this feature
   you have to do it manually. I expect to have support for this in
   Version 0.97 of X-CD-Roast.
<p>
-
<p>
Q: Why is there no Quick-Audio-Copy?

<p>
A: Reading digital Audio from a CD must not be interrupted in order to
   produce a "clean" stream. The problem is, that it is difficult
   to address a specific sector on an Audio-CD, because there are no
   sector-numbers like on a Data-CD. But you have to stop reading from
   time to time to write the read data to harddisk. The longer this
   writing lasts, the greater is the chance that the audio-read device
   loses its track on the current audio-sector...if this happens you 
   have a "click" in the recording. <br>
   When you now want to read audio data and write it at the same time
   to a CD-Recordable the problem with the writing-time is much worse,
   because the CD-Writer is much slower than a harddrive. The result 
   would be a very bad copy...therefore I don't bother with programming
   a quick-audio-copy. (It might be possible with very clever buffering
   and a good knowledge of the devices used...but I dont know what 
   devices you are using and without vendor-support I'm not able to 
   do something like that.)

<p>
Q: Hey, my backspace or delete key doesn't work in entry-fields.
   Is this a bug?

<p>
A: No, this is not a bug, it is just an incorrect key mapping in X11.
   You can fix it by putting this line in your .xinitrc (or if you have
   an Xmodmap-file, by changing the corresponding line.)

	xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
 
<p>
-

<p>
Q: I fail to compile X-CD-Roast, all I get are error-messages.

<p>
A: You have probably a kernel that is too old. Install 2.0 or 
   above.
<font color=#ff0000>Or you dont have all the development-packages
from your linux-distributions
installed. X11-development is needed for example.</font>
<p>
-

<p>
Q: X-CD-Roast failed to detect any of my SCSI-Hardware, what can I do?

<p>
A: Check if you compiled generic SCSI support in the kernel, and if 
   the generic devices exist. To create the generic devices run 

	<p>
	<b>./MAKEDEVICES.sh</b>

   <p>
   in the xcdroast-0.96e directory.

   Next check if you installed "generic-SCSI" support in your kernel. 
   Do a <i>"cat /proc/devices"</i>.. There should be a line "21 sg".
   If not you have to recompile your kernel.
<p>
-
<font color=#ff0000>
<p>
Q: How well are CD-RW-Writers supported?

<p>
A: You can write on CD-RW's exactly like on a CD-Recordable. X-CD-Roast does
   not handle these any differently. To erase a CD-RW you have to call
   cdrecord manually (see the X-CD-Roast logfile where to find cdrecord and
   what your scsi-device is). 
<blockquote>
e.g.: <b>/usr/local/lib/xcdroast-0.96e/bin/cdrecord-1.6.1 dev=4,0 blank=fast</b>
<br>(This will erase the CD-RW in the CD-Writer with the SCSI-ID 4)
</blockquote>
   Future versions of X-CD-Roast will provide a button to do this
   the convenient way.

<p><a name = bugreport>
<b>Q: I think I found a bug, what should I do?</b>

<p>
A: Before you send me a bug-report, check to see whether I mentioned this 
   behavior somewhere in the README file. Then check if all your software 
   and hardware meet the requirements listed in the requirement section of
   the documentation.<p>
   If it is a cdrecord-problem (so anything that relate somehow to 
   CD-writing) check the READMEs that came with cdrecord!<br>
   DONT WRITE ME ABOUT THAT! Ask <a href="mailto: schilling@fokus.gmd.de">
   Joerg Schilling</a> (the author of cdrecord) when you have cdrecord-problems!
   <p>
   Also check to see whether there is a new version of this program is 
   available, look at the primary site: 

     <p>
     <a href = http://www.fh-muenchen.de/rz/xcdroast>http://www.fh-muenchen.de/rz/xcdroast</a>  

   <p>
   Ok, you've done all this and the error persist. 
   <p>
   Supply me with the following information:
     <ol>
   <li> Your kernel and X-CD-Roast version. Also your linux-distribution
        is interesting.
   <li> Try to reproduce the error with "xcdroast -debug" and mail me
        the output.
   <li> A copy of your xcdroast.conf-file. (If you dont have one, mail me
     the list of your scsi-devices)
   <li> An exact description of the error, what you have done and what
     happened. (If a error-window with a stack-trace button pops up, mail
     me the stack trace too. Older versions of Tk output the 
     stack trace in the xterm where you started the program.)

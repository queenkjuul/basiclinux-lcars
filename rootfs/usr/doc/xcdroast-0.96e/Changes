-------------------

          --> changes from non-root-patch by Till Kamppeter <--

09.09.98: Make possible the safe usage of X-CD-Roast by nonroot users. If
          the caller is not root, he cannot enter the 'HD-Setup' screen,
          so he cannot delete hard disks by selecting wrong partitions. This
          part of the configuration he overtakes of root's configuration. He
          also cannot define image-partitions by editing the config file 
          directly, his personal settings here are ignored. He only can choose
          out of the image partitions defined by root on the 'Master Image'
          screen. Because paths for the image files were already ignored before
          it is impossible for the user to write the image into a system
          directory or even overwrite system files.
          It is also easier to get started for an unexperienced user, because
          a non-root user without own configuration file automatically 
          overtakes root's configuration, and so need not to configure 
          X-CD-Roast at the first start.
03.10.98: Improved the security for non-root usage. Disabled the command line
          options '-libdir' and '-configdir' for non-root users, and switched
          to the effective user ID 'root' only for CD access, so the user 
          only can make CD images of data which he is permitted to read and
          he cannot overwrite system files with the log file.
08.11.98: Moved root's configuration file to the library directory of xcdroast
          (default: /usr/local/lib/xcdroast-0.96d/config). So if the home 
          directory of root (normally /root) is desired to be not readable for
          normal users the non-root X-CD-Roast works anyway.

          --> end of changes from non-root-patch by Till Kamppeter <--

21.11.98: After a long, long break I decided to add the most useful patches
	  and bugfixes I received so far. No really new features in this
	  release, but the use of the new cdrecord-1.6.1 and the fixes
	  seemed to make it worth. 
	  Included cdrecord-1.6.1 and mkisofs-1.12b4.
	  Include tkpriv-error-patch from Mark Burton <markb@ordern.com>.
	  Include suse-aware configure-script by Michael Gernoth 
	  <michael.gernoth@fen.baynet.de>
	  Fix zombie-processes of playcdda leftover by play-track
	  Try to fix the 99% verify-problem. Please report if there are
	  still any problems.
	  Add experimental patch use use cdparanoia as audio reader by
	  Adrian Knoth <adi@erfurt.thur.de>
	  (activate with "-usecdparanoia path" switch).
	  Load-Bug concerning mastertype.def fixed.
	  Fix problem when the $-char was used in a scsi-id-string.
22.11.98: Included non-root-patch by Till Kamppeter 
          <till.kamppeter@theo.phy.uni-bayreuth.de>.
          Start X-CD-Roast as root once with the -nonroot switch to
	  activate that mode (See README.nonroot).
23.11.98: Included ATAPI-Patch for readcdda by Deti Fliegl <deti@gmx.de>.
          (Set Audio-Read-Mode to "ATAPI" in the Setup)
25.11.98: New configure-option "--nosuse" to allow to use self-compiled
	  tcl/tk/tix-libs even on a SuSE-System. 
	  Remove "Save Process-Output"-Options in nonroot-mode. It may
	  be possible that these can allow overwriting of system-files.
	  Reworked the CDParanoia-Support. Much nicer now.
	  Try to fix the "X Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid 
	  Window parameter)"-Error when selecting a Image-Partition in the
	  Setup. (This is a TCL-Error - don't know what to do about it)

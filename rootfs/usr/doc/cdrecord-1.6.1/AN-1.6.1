Subject: cdrecord 1.6.1 has been released
Keywords: CD-R CD-RW CDRecord CDwrite SunOS Solaris Linux SGI IRIX FreeBSD NetBSD OpenBSD HP-UX OSF-1

This is Version 1.6.1 of cdrecord

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.
Cdrecord runs on:

SunOS 4.1.3 or later:	sparc.
Solaris 2.3 or later:	sparc and x86.
Linux:			x86 sparc ppc and alpha.
NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD:	x86 sparc
SGI IRIX:		mips
HP-UX:			hppa
AIX:			rs6000
OSF-1:			alpha

NEW features of cdrecord-1.6.1 (shortened):

-	Sector size is reset to the old value after writing a CD. This
	help to use a CD-R/CD-RW drive on Solaris that is jumpered to 512 bytes.
-	-toc behaviour corrected for drives that are jumpered to 512 byte
	sector size.
-	Better AIX support: typo's corrected, workaround for missing SHM_LOCK
-	Handle alinement problem in scsi-linux-sg.c for sparc
-	mkisofs-1.12b4 hacked with new features expected to come up 
	in Eric's mkisofs-1.12b5 release.
-	Added VMS SCSI transport code from Eberhard Heuser-Hofmann
	(still in discussion for the final port)
-	Added PARAIDE SCSI transport code from Grant R. Guenther
	Compile with: make COPTX=-DUSE_PG
-	New SCSI transport code for BSD/OS (BSDi)
	Based on the implementation from Chris P. Ross" <cross@eng.us.uu.net>
-	Check /dev/sg0... before /dev/sga... on Linux
-	Added support for the enhanced Linux sg driver code
	Unfortunately, sg version 2 is still not part of the
	development kernel. If you like to use sg version 2 you 
	should install the patch from:
	ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/alpha/SG.patch.tar.gz
	If you like to do simultaneous access to /dev/sg entries,
	you should install the sg buffer patch from Heiko in 
	addition.
-	New feature of the scsi open code allows to use cdrecord
	on *BSD without the hacky symbolic link /dev/scgx
	Use dev=devicename:target,lun
-	Floating point printf() code for *BSD (4.4BSD derived libc).
	This allows printing of floats on *BSD and Apple Rhapsody.
-	New code to support reading the capacity of a blank media on a 
	Philips CDD-2600
-	New simulation driver allows to check the system performance
	at any write speed.
-	Support for the Kodak PCD-600 and the Pioneer DW-S114X
-	Handle truncated .wav files correctly
-	CD Blank manufacturer list updated
-	Hacky blanking support for JVC CD-RW drives.
	JVC does not give support, I made a guess on the blank command.
-	MMC drives that do not support the read ATIP command (as the HP-7100)
	may now detect the disk manufacturer if the media is completely blank.
-	Cdrecord now compiles on Windows NT using the Cygwin32 B19 compiler.
	I did not test yet, but I expec that compilation on W95 should
	pe possible too.
	Currently not working:
		The FIFO.
		The SCSI transport code.
	I am looking for people who are willing to help me writing a ASPI32
	SCSI rtansport module.
-	Cdrecord now tries to hide the error message from the early
	returning fixating command on Mitsumi drives.
-	Give an error message on Linux if the right /dev/sg* device could
	not be opened.
-	Try to make ATAPI drives work on NetBSD-1.3
-	Give an error message on *BSD if the right device could not be opened.
-	Integrated support for the Sony 928 ATAPI drive.
-	Trying to hide error messages from the user if the drive
	does not like fixating in dummy mode.
-	FreeBSD/cam SCSI transport implementation added.
	FreeBSD/current will switch to CAM simultaneously
	with cdrecord's added CAM support.
	The implementation was mainly done by 
	Kenneth D. Merry <ken@kdm.org>
-	New dev= syntax (dev=devicename:@ or dev=devicename:@,lun)
	to overcome the need for creating a /dev/scgx symlink on 
	non CAM *BSD systems.
-	Cdrecord has been ported to Digital Unix (OSF1)
-	Cdrecord now can really wait for the completion of the
	fixating command on Mitsumi drives.
-	RULES/mk*.id changed back 'tr' strings to ',---' 
	until AIX problem have been cleared.
-	Added support for floatingpoint printing on AIX

I am interested to hear if someone is interested in a kernel based
filesystem for Solaris that uses packet writing on the CD-Recorder.
The filesystem will create a single session CD that may be finally converted
to a hybrid filesystem that allows to be read as 
ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge extensions too.
Please mail suggestions to: wofs@schily.isdn.cs.tu-berlin.de

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.
Cdrecord may be easily ported to any system that has a 
SCSI device driver similar to the scg driver.

The SCSI transport library has been taken from the sformat program.
Sformat is the first SCSI disk formatting/analyzing/repairing that runs on
SunOS/Solaris. The first release of sformat has been made for SunOS 3.0 in 1986
(two years before Sun introduced their format utility). Sformat source
including 12 years of competence in SCSI disk handling is available
on:
	ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/sformat

On SunOS/Solaris:
You *need* the SCSI general driver 'scg' in order to run cdrecord.

SunOS 4.1.3 only:
The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in a loadable format.
There is no future support, there is no non loadable support.

Solaris only:
The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested 
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

Solaris only:
It is _nice to have_ the 'fbk' driver to mount files that contain 
images of file systems. Fbk means File simulates Block Device.
It is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

cdrecord compiles on SunOS, but you will need a specific scg driver for
SunOS in this case.

Cdrecord has been implemented with a Philips CDD 521.
Cdrecord now is maintained with the following drives:

	COMPRO/Matsushita/Panasonic CW-7502
	Philips CDD-2000
	TEAC CD-R55S
	Yamaha CDR-400

It should run also on:

	All SCSI-3/mmc compliant drives
	All ATAPI/mmc compliant drives

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

The following drives will never be supported by cdrecord because they are too old:

	JVC XR-W1001
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-202
	Ricoh RS-9200CD

The following dries are curently not supported because I don't get specs:
(some of them may partially work: see above)

	Creative Labs CDR 4210
	JVC XR-W2001
	JVC XR-W2010
	JVC XR-W2020
	Panasonic CW-7501
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-1000
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-5020
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-5040
	Plasmon CDR-4240
	Ricoh RS-1060C
	Sony CDU-928E does not work, it violates the ATAPI specs
	Sony CDW-900E
	

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

To install get:

	cdrecord-1.6.1.tar.gz	The cdrecord distribution.

	Solaris only:

	SCHILYscg.sparc.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYfbk.sparc.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYscg.i386.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	SCHILYfbk.i386.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (x86).

NOTE:	These tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.

WARNING: Do not use 'mc' to extract the tar file!
	All mc versions before 4.0.14 cannot extract symbolic links correctly.

The files are located on:

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.

If you need mkisofs, it is located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/mkisofs-1.11.tar.gz

but it is also contained in cdrecord-1.6.1

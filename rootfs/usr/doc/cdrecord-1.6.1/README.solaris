Never compile anything in a locale other than "C" unless you are sure
that your C-compiler and the program 'nm' has been patched.
This is not needed with Solrais 2.6 or later and with the Workshop 5.0
compiler or later.

To ensure that locale "C"' is set, do

setenv LC_ALL C

in csh
or

LC_ALL=C
export LC_ALL
in sh

before running make.

The reason:

1)	On Solaris before 2.5.1 'nm' dumps core in any other locale.
	For that reason lorder will not work.
	*** no patch available **** but fixed on Solaris 2.5.1
	according to Sun

2)	The SunPro C-compiler will not convert floating
	point numbers correctly if e.g. in "de" locale (Germany)
	1.3 will be interpreted as 1.0!!!!
	*** patch available ***

If you want to do compilations on Solaris, it is best not have /usr/ucb
in your PATH. If you want to have /usr/ucb in the PATH it must be the last
entry.

To be able to use 'make' 'as' and 'ld' you need to make sure that 
/usr/ccs/bin is in your path.

For CD-Recording please read the README.volmgt too.

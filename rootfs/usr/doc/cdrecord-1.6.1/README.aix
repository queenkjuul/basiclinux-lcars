You need to use GNUmake or my smake to compile on AIX

Read the file README.compile before compiling.

NOTE:	AIX seems to have a kernel bug in the mmap() part
	that may cause kernel panics.

If you observe this kernel panic, try to add a line:

COPTS += -DUSE_USGSHM

to the file cdrecord/Makefile

or compile the package using:

make COPTX=-DUSE_USGSHM

It seems that SVrx style shared memory does not have this kernel bug

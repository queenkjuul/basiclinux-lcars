This is Version 1.6.1 of cdrecord

Cdrecord allows you to create CD's on a CD-Recorder.
Cdrecord runs on:

SunOS 4.1.3 or later:	sparc.
Solaris 2.3 or later:	sparc and x86.
Linux:			x86 sparc ppc and alpha.
NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD:	x86 sparc
SGI IRIX:		mips
HP-UX:			hppa
AIX:			rs6000
OSF1:			alpha

To learn how to compile and install cdrecord, read README.compile

For multi session please read README.multi

Cdrecord runs without problems on a loded Solaris system.
On SunOS, Linux and other systems without realtime scheduler you have to test.

Cdrecord has been designed with a similar user interface as cdwrite
written by
	Adam J. Richter <adam@yggdrasil.com>
now maintained by
	H. Peter Anvin <hpa@transmeta.com>
but the dev= option is slightly different for portability.

The cdrecord distribution contains a SCSI user level transport library.
The SCSI library is suitable to talk to any SCSI device without having
a special driver for it.
Cdrecord may be easily ported to any system that has a 
SCSI device driver similar to the scg driver.

On Linux cdrecord currently uses the /dev/sg? driver 
	- you need no additional driver
On *BSD, SGI IRIX and HP-UX the internal user level SCSI driver is used
but you will not need an OS specific SCSI user library.

On SunOS/Solaris:
You *need* the SCSI general driver 'scg' in order to run cdrecord.

SunOS 4.1.3 only:
The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in a loadable format.
There is no future support, there is no non loadable support.

Solaris only:
The 'scg' driver is Copyright 1986-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested 
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

Solaris only:
It is _nice to have_ the 'fbk' driver to mount files that contain 
images of file systems. Fbk means File simulates Block Device.

The 'fbk' driver is Copyright 1988-1995 Jörg Schilling,
it is supplied binary in pkgadd(1m) format and is tested
on Solaris 2.3, Solaris 2.4 & Solaris 2.5 (sparc).

cdrecord compiles and runs on Solaris x86, thanks to 
gert@fwi.uva.nl (Gert Poletiek) who did the tests.
The bitorder problems have been eliminated.

Cdrecord-1.3 or later adopts the right BUF_SIZE for each architecture.
This is to reduce some performance problems on Solaris x86.
It may be that the reason for this performance problems is that
the PC-architecture has no IO-MMU and therefore is not able to do DVMA.
If this points out to be the reason, I have to
change the scg driver & cdrecord, but this would 
be needed on Linux anyway.

Cdrecord has been implemented with a Philips CDD 521.

All companies that support me with SCSI command reference manuals and drives
will get (continued) support in the following releases.

The following drives will never be supported by cdrecord because they are too old:

	JVC XR-W1001
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-202
	Ricoh RS-9200CD

The following dries are curently not supported because I don't get specs:
(some of them may partially work: see above)

	Creative Labs CDR 4210
	JVC XR-W2001
	JVC XR-W2010
	JVC XR-W2020
	Panasonic CW-7501
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-1000
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-5020
	Pinnacle Micro RCD-5040
	Plasmon CDR-4240
	Ricoh RS-1060C
	Sony CDW-900E
	

To install get:

Solaris only:
	SCHILYscg.sparc.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYfbk.sparc.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (sparc).
	SCHILYscg.i386.tar.Z	The scg driver in pkgadd format (x86).
	SCHILYfbk.i386.tar.Z	The fbk driver in pkgadd format (x86).

Note that the fbk driver packet is for Solaris 2.4 and not system independant.

All Systems:
	cdrecord-1.6.1.tar.gz	The cdrecord for source distribution.

NOTE:	All these tar archives are 100% ansi compatible. Solaris 2.x tar and GNU
	tar may get some minor trouble.

WARNING: Do not use 'mc' to extract the tar file!
	All mc versions before 4.0.14 cannot extract symbolic links correctly.

To unpack the archive use:

	gzip -d < cdrecord.tar.gz | tar -xpf -


The files are located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/ ...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/scg/ ...
ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/kernel/fbk/ ...

If you need mkisofs, it is located on:

ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/mkisofs-1.12.1.tar.gz

but it is also contained in cdrecord-1.6.1



Installation Process:

Solaris only:
	1) scg driver
			untar SCHILYscg.tar:
			su
			Password: xxxxx
			cd /tmp
			zcat SCHILYscg.tar | tar -xvf -
			pkgadd -d .
			reboot -- -r 

	2) fbk driver
			similar to scg driver (see above)

	3) Switch the CD-Writer to an unused target id (2 should do it)
		

NOTE:
	Be very careful. pkgadd does not check for the right target 
	architecture. Do not indstall drivers for intel on sparc
	and vice versa. You will get a corrupt system.

	You need to be root because you need access to /dev/scg? and to be
	able to put cdrecord into the realtime scheduling class.

All Systems:

The SCSI transport library has been taken from the sformat program.
Sformat is the first SCSI disk formatting/analyzing/repairing that runs on
SunOS/Solaris. The first release of sformat has been made for SunOS 3.0
(two years before Sun introduced their format utility). Sformat source
including 10 years of competence in SCSI disk handling is available
on:
	ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/sformat

I am interested to hear if someone is interested in a kernel based
filesystem for Solaris that uses packet writing on the CD-Recorder.
The filesystem will create a single session CD that may be finally converted
to a hybrid filesystem that allows to be read as 
ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge extensions too.
Please mail suggestions to: wofs@schily.isdn.cs.tu-berlin.de

If you want to use the CD-recorder as CD-ROM device, have a look at

<P>When you start Netscape Communicator, you normally see Navigator, your browser. The page that appears automatically is your "home page." Unless you <A HREF="#nav_home">choose a home page</A> yourself, your home page is chosen by your network or Internet service provider, or you see Netscape's home page, Netcenter.</P>

<P>If you're viewing your home page for the first time, explore it. If clicking something takes you to a different page, click Back to retrace your steps.</P>

<P>Some pages are divided into rectangular areas called frames. Each frame can display other pages.</P> 

<!-- Troubleshooting: I can't find the Navigator window. -->

<P>Many organizations block access from the Internet to their networks. This prevents outside parties from gaining access to sensitive information. The protection is called a firewall.</P>

<P>If your organization has a firewall, Communicator may need to go through a proxy server before connecting you to the Internet. The proxy server prevents outsiders from breaking into your organization's private network.</P>

<P>Before you start:</P>

<UL>
<LI>If there's a proxy configuration file at your workplace, ask the system administrator for its URL.
<P></P>
<LI>If there's no proxy configuration file, ask your system administrator for the names and port numbers of the servers running proxy software for each network service.
</UL>

<P>To set Communicator to work with the proxy:</P>

<OL>
<LI>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences.
<P></P>
<LI>Click the Advanced category and choose Proxies.

<LI>Select one of the following:
<P></P>
	<UL>
	<LI>"Direct Connection to the Internet" if you don't have to go through a proxy.
	<P></P>
	<LI>"Automatic proxy configuration" if you have a proxy configuration file. Type the file's URL in the field and click Reload.

	<LI>"Manual proxy configuration" if you don't have a proxy configuration file. Click View
	(Configure on Mac OS), and type your settings and any exceptions (see Details below).
	</UL>
</OL>

<P>Details: Your computer may connect to several different servers (computers that handle networking matters). Each server handles a specific type of network service, such as communicating with HTTP sites or dealing with security. For each server, your manual configuration must specify which server runs the proxy software.</P>

<P>Under "Address of proxy server to use," type the name or numeric IP address of the proxy server for each type of server (HTTP, Security, FTP, Socks, Gopher, and WAIS). Often a single proxy server handles the three major types of server: HTTP, FTP, and Gopher. Under "Port" type each proxy server's port number.</P>

<P>Under Exceptions, type the names of any domains that you can connect to directly, bypassing the proxy. For example, if you type "netscape.com," then the proxy is bypassed each time you view a web page from netscape.com. Domain names are the part of a URL that contains the name of an organization, business, or school--such as netscape.com or washington.org. If you use local host names without the domain name, list them the same way. Use commas to separate multiple hostnames. The wildcard character [*] cannot be used.</P>

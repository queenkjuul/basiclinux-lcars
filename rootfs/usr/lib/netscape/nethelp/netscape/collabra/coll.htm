<P>
The Security Info window gives information about keeping items secure, including web pages and messages
that you send and receive. It also has information about the
current security status of a particular item when it is selected in a window. 
</P>

<P>
You can go to the Security Info window only from a window with a padlock icon in the bottom-left corner. If the padlock is locked, the
selected item or contents in a window and your connection are encrypted. (An encrypted item is scrambled so that no one between the sender's
computer and your computer can read the message or the information.) Some messages include a signed digital certificate that verifies the sender. Messages can be encrypted or signed, or both. 
</P>

<P>
<B>To open the Security Info window and choose a topic:</B> Click the padlock icon, or open the Communicator menu, choose Tools, then Security Info. You see security information about the window or a selected item in the window. You can select other topics. 
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="HELP_SEC_INFO_WEB_PAGE"></A><B>To view security information about a web page:</B> Click the padlock icon while viewing a web site and Security Info will display the status of the web page.  To see additional information about the page, click Open Page Info (encrypted and unencrypted pages).  Click View Certificate (on encrypted pages only) to view the contents of the digital certificate.
</P>



<P>
<A NAME="HELP_SEC_WARNING_CACHE"></A><B>Warning</B> After the Browser Window displays an encrypted page, your disk
cache retains an unencrypted copy of the page. Anyone
with access to your Netscape disk cache can view the contents of the
page.
</P>

<P>
<B>To view security information about a specific mail server or news server:</B> Click the padlock icon in the Messenger window and Security Info will display the status of the mail server connection.  Click the View button for more information about the identity of the message sender.
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="HELP_SEC_INFO_INCOMING"></A><B>To view security about specific messages already received:</B> Select a mail or newsgroup message in the Messenger window. Click the padlock icon and Security Info will display the status of the message. If you select a newsgroup message, you also get security information about the news server.

<P>
A certificate is a unique digital ID that can be used to verify the identity of a person, web site, or JavaScript/Java Applet.  The certificate always includes a public key, the name of the entity it identifies, an expiration date, the name of the certificate authority (CA) that issued the certificate, the digital signature of the CA, and a serial number. These certificates use public key cryptography to sign and authenticate signatures and are protected by public and private key pairs linked by cryptographic algorithms.  These keys have the ability to encrypt and decrypt information.
</P>

<P>
<B>To get more information about certificates:</B> Open the Security Info window by clicking the padlock icon, then select Certificates. 
</P>

<P>
<B>To get your own certificates:</B> Open the Security Info window by clicking the padlock icon, select Certificates, then Yours. Scroll to the bottom of the window and click Get Certificate.  In response, Netscape Navigator connects you to a certificate authority (CA) that issues certificates. 
</P>

<P>If you use several computers, or switch computers, you must use the Import and Export features to transfer you certificates.  To use encryption, you must have your certificates on the computer that you are using.
</P>


<P>
<B>To import your certificates from another computer:</B> Open the Security Info window by clicking the padlock icon, select Certificates, then Yours. Scroll to the bottom of the window and click Import a Certificate.  If you have not set up a password, you are urged to do it. Then choose the file that contains your certificate and click OK. 
</P>

<P>
<B>To export your certificates:</B> Open the Security Info window by clicking the padlock icon, select Certificates, then Yours. Scroll to the bottom of the window and click Export.

Netscape has warning options that alert you to possibly unsafe situations.  To configure these options, open the Security window by clicking the padlock icon, then select Navigator.
</P>

<P>
Check the warnings you want displayed. It is a good idea to keep all these alerts as reminders. Here's why: 
</P>


<P>
<B>Entering an encrypted site:</B> Because the pages are decrypted without your intervention, you may want to clean up or secure downloaded files upon completion of your session.
</P>

<P>
<B>Leaving an encrypted site:</B> You may want to remove decrypted files left on your local drive.  Web pages are encrypted only during transmission.
</P>

<P>
<A NAME="HELP_SEC_WARNING_MIXED"></A><B>Viewing a page with an encrypted/unencrypted mix:</B> If you feel that your system is not protected, you may not want to open this page.
</P>

<P>
<B>Sending unencrypted information to a site:</B> This warning reminds you not to submit unencrypted forms or information through email.
</P>

<P>
After you have checked the warnings you want to display, click the pop-up menu to choose what you want Navigator to do when a web site asks for your certificate. If you visit multiple web sites that require different types of certificate, choose Ask Every Time. Otherwise, choose Select Automatically. 
</P>

<P>
<B>Warning:</B> Do not change the options or click the buttons for Advanced Security (SSL) Configuration unless you have specialized knowledge.

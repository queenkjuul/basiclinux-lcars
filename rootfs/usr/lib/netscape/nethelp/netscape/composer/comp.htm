<P>If you understand HTML, you can insert HTML form tags, JavaScript, and plug-in code that aren't available from Composer's Format menu. Although the Composer does not display these objects, it inserts special HTML tag icons to show where they are.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="tagicon2.gif" HEIGHT=120 WIDTH=160></P>

<P>To insert HTML tags:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Click where you want to insert the tag.</LI>
<P></P>
<LI>Open the Insert menu and choose HTML Tag.</LI>
<P></P>
<LI>Type an HTML tag. The tag will be inserted in your document at the current cursor location. Type only one tag at a time (see example, below).</LI>
<P></P>
<LI>Click Verify to have Composer check the HTML you've typed.</LI>
<P>Composer checks that you have both opening and closing brackets &lt; > around your HTML, and quotation marks around any attribute text.</P>
<LI>Click OK.</LI>

<P>Example:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>&lt;applet code="HelloWorld.class" width=100 height=30>
<BR>&lt;param name=text value="Hello World!">
<BR>&lt;/applet>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In this example, you would type the first line in the dialog box and click OK. Then you would open the HTML Tag dialog box again, type the second line, and click OK. You repeat this procedure for each tag you want to add to your page.</P>

<P>To edit a tag:</P>

   How do I purchase technical support?
   The SupportEdge technical support program has a range of offerings to
   meet the requirements of both large organizations and individuals. In
   North America, corporate customers who want to learn about the program
   and purchase support for the first time should call 650/937-2555. A
   corporate sales representative will answer your questions and give you
   a price quote for the support offering that best suits your needs. If
   you are renewing an existing corporate technical support contract,
   please call 650/937-2929 or send us email; a corporate renewals
   representative will contact you.
   
   Personal Edition users who are interested in renewing their support or
   are buying it for the first time should call 650/937-3777 or email us.
   
   For customers outside North America please contact your local Netscape
   office or authorized reseller.
   
   In addition, the online Netscape Store has some support offerings
   available for credit card purchase.
   
   Is any support included with the purchase of a product?
   For any product that has been purchased, installation assistance is
   included. For 90 days from the date of purchase, customers are
   entitled to installation assistance on all Netscape products, with the
   exception of Netscape CommerceXpert. Netscape's business hours for the
   Netscape Navigator/Communicator family of products only are Monday
   through Friday, 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. PT, and Saturday and Sunday, 8 a.m.
   to 5 p.m. PT. For server and tools products, Netscape's hours of
   operation are Monday through Friday, 5 a.m. through 5 p.m. PT.
   
   For any product that has been downloaded free (such as Navigator and
   Communicator Standard Edition), the free support options include our
   online help site, newsgroups, or free automated phone support (call
   800/411-0707, option 1). To be able to speak with a technical support
   engineer, you must purchase a support agreement or call 800/411-0707,
   option 2, to place a $25 credit card call.
   
   Does Netscape offer any online technical support?
   Yes. Netscape offers free online support 24 hours a day, 7 days a
   week, at http://help.netscape.com. This site contains a wealth of
   information, including newsgroups, a search engine, answers to
   frequently asked questions, and a patch/file library. All these
   services are designed to help you help yourself - at your convenience.
   In addition, customers can support each other through the forum of
   NUGgies, the Netscape User Group online discussion groups.
   
   Is support available on a per-incident basis?
   Yes. Netscape offers both frontline and backline packs of 5, 10, 15,
   and 25 incidents, depending on which offering you choose. You can also
   select a pay-as-you-go method, which lets you get help on a single
   incident by providing a credit card at the time you call. (An incident
   is defined as a single, discrete problem.) Check out the SupportEdge
   description for more details.
   
   What do frontline and backline mean?
   If you are an individual or small office, and don't have a help desk
   to contact with your question, you would call Netscape directly and
   speak with a level 1 engineer. Netscape's frontline offerings include
   pay-as-you-go and Incident Packs.
   
   For organizations that handle the first calls from their user base
   through some sort of help desk - often an internal IS desk - our
   backline offerings are a more appropriate choice because your expert
   calls a Netscape expert, one of our level 3 engineers. Typical
   candidates for backline support are large businesses, Internet service
   providers, system integrators, and larger VARs. Netscape's backline
   offerings include Incident Packs and annual contracts.
   
   Is 24-hour, 7-day support available?
   Yes. Round-the-clock support is available as part of two of Netscape's
   backline offerings, Expert-to-Expert and Expert Alliance. Many
   customers use Netscape products to run mission-critical applications.
   For more information on 24-hour, 7-day support coverage, see the
   SupportEdge description or call a Netscape sales representative at
   650/937-2555. For minor technical problems, free support is available
   24 hours a day, 7 days a week on the Netscape online technical support
   site.
   
   The two highest levels of Netscape support refer to an assigned or
   dedicated engineer. How do the two differ?
   An assigned engineer is the technical support engineer that you
   contact directly for all your support issues (as opposed to going
   through a phone queue). That engineer - who may support several
   accounts such as yours - becomes familiar with your account and
   provides a consistent point of contact. A dedicated engineer, on the
   other hand, works full-time on your support issues. Netscape's highest
   level of support, Expert Alliance, provides you with an assigned
   engineer; however, you have the option to upgrade to a dedicated
   engineer if you wish.
   
   Can I get support on my developer questions?
   Yes, developer support is now available for large customers (corporate
   IT organizations developing in-house applications using Netscape
   products or OEMs integrating Netscape products into their technology)
   that have the Expert Alliance or Expert-to-Expert program. The
   developer support option provides advice on coding approaches and help
   with Netscape ONE technologies. You receive sample code and assistance
   in reviewing test cases of code to help identify problems. A
   membership in the DevEdge Community program is included.
   
   What is Netscape's end-of-life policy; in other words, how many
   versions of Netscape products do you support?
   Technical support is available for the current release and one prior
   release of major and minor versions of Netscape products. The renewals
   department will renew your technical support agreement if you are
   using the latest release or one release prior to the current version.
   To contact the renewals department, please call 650/937-2929 or send
   an email; a corporate renewals representative will give you a price
   quote.
   
   Does my Netscape technical support purchase cover any software
   upgrades?
   No. Major and minor software upgrades are not covered under a
   technical support agreement. For information on how to keep your
   Netscape software current, enterprise customers can go to the Netscape
   Enterprise Subscription Program page. Individuals should see the
   Netscape Subscriber Advantage Program. The subscription programs do
   not provide any technical support; the programs are mutually
   exclusive.

This directory contains the GNU movemail program, a utility for locking files
in the way in which the local mail delivery agent (hopefully) respects.

This program is not a part of Netscape Navigator; movemail is free software,
but Netscape Navigator is not.  movemail is provided here merely as a
convenience for those using systems on which Netscape Navigator cannot
otherwise be easily configured to retrieve mail from the spool directory
without using an external program.

movemail is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY
WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

The license for movemail may be found in the file COPYING.

Discussion of the use of movemail with Netscape Navigator may be found at:

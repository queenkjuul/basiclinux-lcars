<p><br><a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    
<p><br>This program is part of the <strong>Samba</strong> suite.
<p><br><strong>smbclient</strong> is a client that can 'talk' to an SMB/CIFS server. It
offers an interface similar to that of the ftp program (see <strong>ftp
(1)</strong>).  Operations include things like getting files from the server
to the local machine, putting files from the local machine to the
server, retrieving directory information from the server and so on.
<p><br><a name="OPTIONS"></a>
<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
    
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><a name="servicename"></a>
<li><strong><strong>servicename</strong></strong> servicename is the name of the service you want
to use on the server. A service name takes the form
<code>//server/service</code> where <em>server</em> is the NetBIOS name of the SMB/CIFS
server offering the desired service and <em>service</em> is the name
of the service offered. Thus to connect to the service <em>printer</em> on
the SMB/CIFS server <em>smbserver</em>, you would use the servicename
<p><br><code>//smbserver/printer</code>
<p><br>Note that the server name required is NOT necessarily the IP (DNS)
host name of the server ! The name required is a NetBIOS server name,
which may or may not be the same as the IP hostname of the machine
running the server.
<p><br>The server name is looked up according to either the
<a href="smbclient.1.html#minusR"><strong>-R</strong></a> parameter to <strong>smbclient</strong> or using the
<a href="smb.conf.5.html#nameresolveorder"><strong>name resolve order</strong></a>
parameter in the smb.conf file, allowing an administrator to change
the order and methods by which server names are looked up.
<p><br><a name="password"></a>
<li><strong><strong>password</strong></strong> password is the password required to access the
specified service on the specified server. If this parameter is
supplied, the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusN"><strong>-N</strong></a> option (suppress password prompt) is assumed.
<p><br>There is no default password. If no password is supplied on the
command line (either by using this parameter or adding a password to
the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusU"><strong>-U</strong></a> option (see below)) and the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusN"><strong>-N</strong></a> option is not specified,
the client will prompt for a password, even if the desired service
does not require one. (If no password is required, simply press ENTER
to provide a null password.)
<p><br>Note: Some servers (including OS/2 and Windows for Workgroups) insist
on an uppercase password. Lowercase or mixed case passwords may be
rejected by these servers.
<p><br>Be cautious about including passwords in scripts.
<p><br><a name="minuss"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-s smb.conf</strong></strong> This parameter specifies the pathname to the
Samba configuration file, smb.conf. This file controls all aspects of
the Samba setup on the machine and smbclient also needs to read this
file.
<p><br><a name="minusB"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-B IP addr</strong></strong> The IP address to use when sending a broadcast packet.
<p><br><a name="minusO"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-O socket options</strong></strong> TCP socket options to set on the client
socket. See the <a href="smb.conf.5.html#socketoptions">socket options</a>
parameter in the <a href="smb.conf.5.html"><strong>smb.conf (5)</strong></a> manpage for
the list of valid options.
<p><br><a name="minusR"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-R name resolve order</strong></strong> This option allows the user of
smbclient to determine what name resolution services to use when
looking up the NetBIOS name of the host being connected to.
<p><br>The options are :"lmhosts", "host", "wins" and "bcast". They cause
names to be resolved as follows :
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > <strong>lmhosts</strong> : Lookup an IP address in the Samba lmhosts file.
The lmhosts file is stored in the same directory as the
<a href="smb.conf.5.html"><strong>smb.conf</strong></a> file.
<p><br><li > <strong>host</strong> : Do a standard host name to IP address resolution,
using the system /etc/hosts, NIS, or DNS lookups. This method of name
resolution is operating system depended for instance on IRIX or
Solaris this may be controlled by the <em>/etc/nsswitch.conf</em> file).  
<p><br><li > <strong>wins</strong> : Query a name with the IP address listed in the <a href="smb.conf.5.html#winsserver"><strong>wins
server</strong></a> parameter in the smb.conf file. If 
no WINS server has been specified this method will be ignored.
<p><br><li > <strong>bcast</strong> : Do a broadcast on each of the known local interfaces
listed in the <a href="smb.conf.5.html#interfaces"><strong>interfaces</strong></a> parameter
in the smb.conf file. This is the least reliable of the name resolution
methods as it depends on the target host being on a locally connected
subnet. To specify a particular broadcast address the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusB"><strong>-B</strong></a> option 
may be used.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br>If this parameter is not set then the name resolve order defined
in the <a href="smb.conf.5.html"><strong>smb.conf</strong></a> file parameter 
<a href="smb.conf.5.html#nameresolveorder">(<strong>name resolve order</strong>)</a>
will be used.
<p><br>The default order is lmhosts, host, wins, bcast and without this
parameter or any entry in the <a href="smb.conf.5.html#nameresolveorder"><strong>"name resolve
order"</strong></a> parameter of the
<a href="smb.conf.5.html"><strong>smb.conf</strong></a> file the name resolution methods
will be attempted in this order.
<p><br><a name="minusM"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-M NetBIOS name</strong></strong> This options allows you to send messages,
using the "WinPopup" protocol, to another computer. Once a connection
is established you then type your message, pressing ^D (control-D) to
end.
<p><br>If the receiving computer is running WinPopup the user will receive
the message and probably a beep. If they are not running WinPopup the
message will be lost, and no error message will occur.
<p><br>The message is also automatically truncated if the message is over
1600 bytes, as this is the limit of the protocol.
<p><br>One useful trick is to cat the message through <strong>smbclient</strong>.
For example:
<p><br><code>cat mymessage.txt | smbclient -M FRED</code>
<p><br>will send the message in the file <em>mymessage.txt</em> to the machine FRED.
<p><br>You may also find the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusU"><strong>-U</strong></a> and <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusI"><strong>-I</strong></a> options useful, as they allow
you to control the FROM and TO parts of the message.
<p><br>See the <a href="smb.conf.5.html#messagecommand"><strong>message command</strong></a>
parameter in the <strong>smb.conf (5)</strong> for a description of how to handle
incoming WinPopup messages in Samba.
<p><br>Note: Copy WinPopup into the startup group on your WfWg PCs if you
want them to always be able to receive messages.
<p><br><a name="minusi"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-i scope</strong></strong> This specifies a NetBIOS scope that smbclient will use
to communicate with when generating NetBIOS names. For details on the
use of NetBIOS scopes, see rfc1001.txt and rfc1002.txt. NetBIOS scopes
are <em>very</em> rarely used, only set this parameter if you are the
system administrator in charge of all the NetBIOS systems you
communicate with.
<p><br><a name="minusN"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-N</strong></strong> If specified, this parameter suppresses the normal
password prompt from the client to the user. This is useful when
accessing a service that does not require a password.
<p><br>Unless a password is specified on the command line or this parameter
is specified, the client will request a password.
<p><br><a name="minusn"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-n NetBIOS name</strong></strong> By default, the client will use the local
machine's hostname (in uppercase) as its NetBIOS name. This parameter
allows you to override the host name and use whatever NetBIOS name you
wish.
<p><br><a name="minusd"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-d debuglevel</strong></strong> debuglevel is an integer from 0 to 10, or the
letter 'A'.
<p><br>The default value if this parameter is not specified is zero.
<p><br>The higher this value, the more detail will be logged to the log files
about the activities of the client. At level 0, only critical errors
and serious warnings will be logged. Level 1 is a reasonable level for
day to day running - it generates a small amount of information about
operations carried out.
<p><br>Levels above 1 will generate considerable amounts of log data, and
should only be used when investigating a problem. Levels above 3 are
designed for use only by developers and generate HUGE amounts of log
data, most of which is extremely cryptic. If debuglevel is set to the
letter 'A', then <em>all</em> debug messages will be printed. This setting
is for developers only (and people who <em>really</em> want to know how the
code works internally).
<p><br>Note that specifying this parameter here will override the <a href="smb.conf.5.html#loglevel"><strong>log
level</strong></a> parameter in the <a href="smb.conf.5.html"><strong>smb.conf
(5)</strong></a> file.
<p><br><a name="minusP"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-P</strong></strong> This option is no longer used. The code in Samba2.0
now lets the server decide the device type, so no printer specific
flag is needed.
<p><br><a name="minusp"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-p port</strong></strong> This number is the TCP port number that will be used
when making connections to the server. The standard (well-known) TCP
port number for an SMB/CIFS server is 139, which is the default.
<p><br><a name="minusl"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-l logfilename</strong></strong> If specified, logfilename specifies a base
filename into which operational data from the running client will be
logged.
<p><br>The default base name is specified at compile time.
<p><br>The base name is used to generate actual log file names. For example,
if the name specified was "log", the debug file would be
<code>log.client</code>.
<p><br>The log file generated is never removed by the client.
<p><br><a name="minush"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-h</strong></strong> Print the usage message for the client.
<p><br><a name="minusI"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-I IP address</strong></strong> IP address is the address of the server to
connect to. It should be specified in standard "a.b.c.d" notation.
<p><br>Normally the client would attempt to locate a named SMB/CIFS server by
looking it up via the NetBIOS name resolution mechanism described
above in the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusR"><strong>name resolve order</strong></a> parameter
above. Using this parameter will force the client to assume that the
server is on the machine with the specified IP address and the NetBIOS
name component of the resource being connected to will be ignored.
<p><br>There is no default for this parameter. If not supplied, it will be
determined automatically by the client as described above.
<p><br><a name="minusE"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-E</strong></strong> This parameter causes the client to write messages to the
standard error stream (stderr) rather than to the standard output
stream.
<p><br>By default, the client writes messages to standard output - typically
the user's tty.
<p><br><a name="minusU"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-U username</strong></strong> This specifies the user name that will be used by
the client to make a connection, assuming your server is not a downlevel
server that is running a protocol level that uses passwords on shares,
not on usernames.
<p><br>Some servers are fussy about the case of this name, and some insist
that it must be a valid NetBIOS name.
<p><br>If no username is supplied, it will default to an uppercase version of
the environment variable <code>USER</code> or <code>LOGNAME</code> in that order.  If no
username is supplied and neither environment variable exists the
username "GUEST" will be used.
<p><br>If the <code>USER</code> environment variable contains a '%' character,
everything after that will be treated as a password. This allows you
to set the environment variable to be <code>USER=username%password</code> so
that a password is not passed on the command line (where it may be
seen by the ps command).
<p><br>If the service you are connecting to requires a password, it can be
supplied using the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusU"><strong>-U</strong></a> option, by appending a percent symbol ("%")
then the password to username.  For example, to attach to a service as
user <code>"fred"</code> with password <code>"secret"</code>, you would specify. <br>
<p><br><code>-U fred%secret</code> <br>
<p><br>on the command line. Note that there are no spaces around the percent
symbol.
<p><br>If you specify the password as part of username then the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusN"><strong>-N</strong></a> option
(suppress password prompt) is assumed.
<p><br>If you specify the password as a parameter <em>AND</em> as part of username
then the password as part of username will take precedence. Putting
nothing before or nothing after the percent symbol will cause an empty
username or an empty password to be used, respectively.
<p><br>The password may also be specified by setting up an environment
variable called <code>PASSWORD</code> that contains the users password. Note
that this may be very insecure on some systems but on others allows
users to script smbclient commands without having a password appear in
the command line of a process listing.
<p><br>Note: Some servers (including OS/2 and Windows for Workgroups) insist
on an uppercase password. Lowercase or mixed case passwords may be
rejected by these servers.
<p><br>Be cautious about including passwords in scripts or in the
<code>PASSWORD</code> environment variable. Also, on many systems the command
line of a running process may be seen via the <code>ps</code> command to be
safe always allow smbclient to prompt for a password and type it in
directly.
<p><br><a name="minusL"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-L</strong></strong> This option allows you to look at what services are
available on a server. You use it as <code>"smbclient -L host"</code> and a
list should appear.  The <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusI"><strong>-I</strong></a> option may be useful if your NetBIOS
names don't match your tcp/ip dns host names or if you are trying to
reach a host on another network.
<p><br><a name="minust"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-t terminal code</strong></strong> This option tells smbclient how to interpret
filenames coming from the remote server. Usually Asian language
multibyte UNIX implementations use different character sets than
SMB/CIFS servers (<em>EUC</em> instead of <em>SJIS</em> for example). Setting
this parameter will let smbclient convert between the UNIX filenames
and the SMB filenames correctly. This option has not been seriously
tested and may have some problems.
<p><br>The terminal codes include <code>sjis</code>, <code>euc</code>, <code>jis7</code>, <code>jis8</code>,
<code>junet</code>, <code>hex</code>, <code>cap</code>. This is not a complete list, check the
Samba source code for the complete list.
<p><br><a name="minusm"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-m max protocol level</strong></strong> With the new code in Samba2.0,
<strong>smbclient</strong> always attempts to connect at the maximum
protocols level the server supports. This parameter is
preserved for backwards compatibility, but any string
following the <strong>-m</strong> will be ignored.
<p><br><a name="minusW"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-W WORKGROUP</strong></strong> Override the default workgroup specified in the
<a href="smb.conf.5.html#workgroup"><strong>workgroup</strong></a> parameter of the
<a href="smb.conf.5.html"><strong>smb.conf</strong></a> file for this connection. This may
be needed to connect to some servers.
<p><br><a name="minusT"></a> <li><strong><strong>-T tar options</strong></strong> smbclient may be used to create
<strong>tar (1)</strong> compatible backups of all the files on an SMB/CIFS
share. The secondary tar flags that can be given to this option are :
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li><strong><strong>c</strong></strong> Create a tar file on UNIX. Must be followed by the
	name of a tar file, tape device or <code>"-"</code> for standard output. If
	using standard output you must turn the log level to its lowest value
    <code>-d0</code> to avoid corrupting your tar file. This flag is
	mutually exclusive with the <strong>x</strong> flag.
<p><br><li><strong><strong>x</strong></strong> Extract (restore) a local tar file back to a
	share. Unless the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusD"><strong>-D</strong></a> option is given, the tar files will be
	restored from the top level of the share. Must be followed by the name
	of the tar file, device or <code>"-"</code> for standard input. Mutually exclusive
	with the <strong>c</strong> flag. Restored files have their creation times (mtime)
	set to the date saved in the tar file. Directories currently do not
	get their creation dates restored properly.
<p><br><li><strong><strong>I</strong></strong> Include files and directories. Is the default
	behavior when filenames are specified above. Causes tar files to
	be included in an extract or create (and therefore everything else to
	be excluded). See example below.  Filename globbing works 
	in one of two ways.  See <strong>r</strong> below.
<p><br><li><strong><strong>X</strong></strong> Exclude files and directories. Causes tar files to
	be excluded from an extract or create. See example below.  Filename
	globbing works in one of two ways now. See <strong>r</strong> below.
<p><br><li><strong><strong>b</strong></strong> Blocksize. Must be followed by a valid (greater than
	zero) blocksize.  Causes tar file to be written out in
	blocksize*TBLOCK (usually 512 byte) blocks.
<p><br><li><strong><strong>g</strong></strong> Incremental. Only back up files that have the
	archive bit set. Useful only with the <strong>c</strong> flag.
<p><br><li><strong><strong>q</strong></strong> Quiet. Keeps tar from printing diagnostics as it
	works.  This is the same as tarmode quiet.
<p><br><li><strong><strong>r</strong></strong> Regular expression include or exclude.  Uses regular 
	regular expression matching for excluding or excluding files if 
	compiled with HAVE_REGEX_H. However this mode can be very slow. If 
	not compiled with HAVE_REGEX_H, does a limited wildcard match on * and 
	?.
<p><br><li><strong><strong>N</strong></strong> Newer than. Must be followed by the name of a file
	whose date is compared against files found on the share during a
	create. Only files newer than the file specified are backed up to the
	tar file. Useful only with the <strong>c</strong> flag.
<p><br><li><strong><strong>a</strong></strong> Set archive bit. Causes the archive bit to be reset
	when a file is backed up. Useful with the <strong>g</strong> and <strong>c</strong> flags.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br><em>Tar Long File Names</em>
<p><br>smbclient's tar option now supports long file names both on backup and
restore. However, the full path name of the file must be less than
1024 bytes.  Also, when a tar archive is created, smbclient's tar
option places all files in the archive with relative names, not
absolute names.
<p><br><em>Tar Filenames</em>
<p><br>All file names can be given as DOS path names (with <code>\</code> as the
component separator) or as UNIX path names (with <code>/</code> as the
component separator).
<p><br><em>Examples</em>
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><li > Restore from tar file backup.tar into myshare on mypc (no password on share).
<p><br><code>smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -Tx backup.tar</code>
<p><br><li > Restore everything except users/docs
<p><br><code>smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -TXx backup.tar users/docs</code>
<p><br><li > Create a tar file of the files beneath users/docs.
<p><br><code>smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -Tc backup.tar users/docs</code>
<p><br><li > Create the same tar file as above, but now use a DOS path name.
<p><br><code>smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -tc backup.tar users\edocs</code>
<p><br><li > Create a tar file of all the files and directories in the share.
<p><br><code>smbclient //mypc/myshare "" -N -Tc backup.tar *</code>
<p><br></ul>
<p><br><a name="minusD"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-D initial directory</strong></strong> Change to initial directory before
starting. Probably only of any use with the tar <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusT"><strong>-T</strong></a> option.
<p><br><a name="minusc"></a>
<li><strong><strong>-c command string</strong></strong> command string is a semicolon separated
list of commands to be executed instead of prompting from stdin.
<a href="smbclient.1.html#minusN"><strong>-N</strong></a> is implied by <strong>-c</strong>.
<p><br>This is particularly useful in scripts and for printing stdin to the
server, e.g. <code>-c 'print -'</code>.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br><a name="OPERATIONS"></a>
<h2>OPERATIONS</h2>
    
<p><br>Once the client is running, the user is presented with a prompt :
<p><br><code>smb:\&gt;</code>
<p><br>The backslash ("\") indicates the current working directory on the
server, and will change if the current working directory is changed.
<p><br>The prompt indicates that the client is ready and waiting to carry out
a user command. Each command is a single word, optionally followed by
parameters specific to that command. Command and parameters are
space-delimited unless these notes specifically state otherwise. All
commands are case-insensitive.  Parameters to commands may or may not
be case sensitive, depending on the command.
<p><br>You can specify file names which have spaces in them by quoting the
name with double quotes, for example "a long file name".
<p><br>Parameters shown in square brackets (e.g., "[parameter]") are
optional. If not given, the command will use suitable
defaults. Parameters shown in angle brackets (e.g., "&lt;parameter&gt;") are
required.
<p><br>Note that all commands operating on the server are actually performed
by issuing a request to the server. Thus the behavior may vary from
server to server, depending on how the server was implemented.
<p><br>The commands available are given here in alphabetical order.
<p><br><ul>
<p><br><a name="questionmark"></a> <li><strong><strong>? [command]</strong></strong> If "command" is specified,
the <strong>?</strong> command will display a brief informative message about the
specified command.  If no command is specified, a list of available
commands will be displayed.
<p><br><a name="exclaimationmark"></a> <li><strong><strong>! [shell command]</strong></strong> If "shell command"
is specified, the <strong>!</strong>  command will execute a shell locally and run
the specified shell command. If no command is specified, a local shell
will be run.
<p><br><a name="cd"></a> <li><strong><strong>cd [directory name]</strong></strong> If "directory name" is
specified, the current working directory on the server will be changed
to the directory specified. This operation will fail if for any reason
the specified directory is inaccessible.
<p><br>If no directory name is specified, the current working directory on
the server will be reported.
<p><br><a name="del"></a> <li><strong><strong>del &lt;mask&gt;</strong></strong> The client will request that the server
attempt to delete all files matching "mask" from the current working
directory on the server.
<p><br><a name="dir"></a> <li><strong><strong>dir &lt;mask&gt;</strong></strong> A list of the files matching "mask" in
the current working directory on the server will be retrieved from the
server and displayed.
<p><br><a name="exit"></a> <li><strong><strong>exit</strong></strong> Terminate the connection with the server and
exit from the program.
<p><br><a name="get"></a> <li><strong><strong>get &lt;remote file name&gt; [local file name]</strong></strong> Copy the
file called "remote file name" from the server to the machine running
the client. If specified, name the local copy "local file name".  Note
that all transfers in smbclient are binary. See also the
<a href="smbclient.1.html#lowercase"><strong>lowercase</strong></a> command.
<p><br><a name="help"></a> <li><strong><strong>help [command]</strong></strong> See the <a href="smbclient.1.html#questionmark"><strong>?</strong></a>
command above.
<p><br><a name="lcd"></a> <li><strong><strong>lcd [directory name]</strong></strong> If "directory name" is
specified, the current working directory on the local machine will
be changed to the directory specified. This operation will fail if for
any reason the specified directory is inaccessible.
<p><br>If no directory name is specified, the name of the current working
directory on the local machine will be reported.
<p><br><a name="lowercase"></a> <li><strong><strong>lowercase</strong></strong> Toggle lowercasing of filenames
for the <a href="smbclient.1.html#get"><strong>get</strong></a> and <a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a> commands.
<p><br>When lowercasing is toggled ON, local filenames are converted to
lowercase when using the <a href="smbclient.1.html#get"><strong>get</strong></a> and <a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a>
commands. This is often useful when copying (say) MSDOS files from a
server, because lowercase filenames are the norm on UNIX systems.
<p><br><a name="ls"></a> <li><strong><strong>ls &lt;mask&gt;</strong></strong> See the <a href="smbclient.1.html#dir"><strong>dir</strong></a> command above.
<p><br><a name="mask"></a> <li><strong><strong>mask &lt;mask&gt;</strong></strong> This command allows the user to set
up a mask which will be used during recursive operation of the
<a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a> and <a href="smbclient.1.html#mput"><strong>mput</strong></a> commands.
<p><br>The masks specified to the <a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a> and
<a href="smbclient.1.html#mput"><strong>mput</strong></a> commands act as filters for directories rather
than files when recursion is toggled ON.
<p><br>The mask specified with the .B mask command is necessary to filter
files within those directories. For example, if the mask specified in
an <a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a> command is "source*" and the mask specified
with the mask command is "*.c" and recursion is toggled ON, the
<a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a> command will retrieve all files matching "*.c" in
all directories below and including all directories matching "source*"
in the current working directory.
<p><br>Note that the value for mask defaults to blank (equivalent to "*") and
remains so until the mask command is used to change it. It retains the
most recently specified value indefinitely. To avoid unexpected
results it would be wise to change the value of .I mask back to "*"
after using the <a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a> or <a href="smbclient.1.html#mput"><strong>mput</strong></a> commands.
<p><br><a name="md"></a> <li><strong><strong>md &lt;directory name&gt;</strong></strong> See the <a href="smbclient.1.html#mkdir"><strong>mkdir</strong></a>
command.
<p><br><a name="mget"></a> <li><strong><strong>mget &lt;mask&gt;</strong></strong> Copy all files matching mask from the
server to the machine running the client.
<p><br>Note that mask is interpreted differently during recursive operation
and non-recursive operation - refer to the <a href="smbclient.1.html#recurse"><strong>recurse</strong></a>
and <a href="smbclient.1.html#mask"><strong>mask</strong></a> commands for more information. Note that all
transfers in .B smbclient are binary. See also the
<a href="smbclient.1.html#lowercase"><strong>lowercase</strong></a> command.
<p><br><a name="mkdir"></a> <li><strong><strong>mkdir &lt;directory name&gt;</strong></strong> Create a new directory on
the server (user access privileges permitting) with the specified
name.
<p><br><a name="mput"></a> <li><strong><strong>mput &lt;mask&gt;</strong></strong> Copy all files matching mask in
the current working directory on the local machine to the current
working directory on the server.
<p><br>Note that mask is interpreted differently during recursive operation
and non-recursive operation - refer to the <a href="smbclient.1.html#recurse"><strong>recurse</strong></a>
and <a href="smbclient.1.html#mask"><strong>mask</strong></a> commands for more information. Note that all
transfers in .B smbclient are binary.
<p><br><a name="print"></a> <li><strong><strong>print &lt;file name&gt;</strong></strong> Print the specified file
from the local machine through a printable service on the server.
<p><br>See also the <a href="smbclient.1.html#printmode"><strong>printmode</strong></a> command.
<p><br><a name="printmode"></a> <li><strong><strong>printmode &lt;graphics or text&gt;</strong></strong> Set the print
mode to suit either binary data (such as graphical information) or
text. Subsequent print commands will use the currently set print
mode.
<p><br><a name="prompt"></a> <li><strong><strong>prompt</strong></strong> Toggle prompting for filenames during
operation of the <a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a> and <a href="smbclient.1.html#mput"><strong>mput</strong></a>
commands.
<p><br>When toggled ON, the user will be prompted to confirm the transfer of
each file during these commands. When toggled OFF, all specified files
will be transferred without prompting.
<p><br><a name="put"></a> <li><strong><strong>put &lt;local file name&gt; [remote file name]</strong></strong> Copy the
file called "local file name" from the machine running the client to
the server. If specified, name the remote copy "remote file name".
Note that all transfers in smbclient are binary. See also the
<a href="smbclient.1.html#lowercase"><strong>lowercase</strong></a> command.
<p><br><a name="queue"></a> <li><strong><strong>queue</strong></strong> Displays the print queue, showing the job
id, name, size and current status.
<p><br><a name="quit"></a> <li><strong><strong>quit</strong></strong> See the <a href="smbclient.1.html#exit"><strong>exit</strong></a> command.
<p><br><a name="rd"></a> <li><strong><strong>rd &lt;directory name&gt;</strong></strong> See the <a href="smbclient.1.html#rmdir"><strong>rmdir</strong></a>
command.
<p><br><a name="recurse"></a> <li><strong><strong>recurse</strong></strong> Toggle directory recursion for the
commands <a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a> and <a href="smbclient.1.html#mput"><strong>mput</strong></a>.
<p><br>When toggled ON, these commands will process all directories in the
source directory (i.e., the directory they are copying .IR from ) and
will recurse into any that match the mask specified to the
command. Only files that match the mask specified using the
<a href="smbclient.1.html#mask"><strong>mask</strong></a> command will be retrieved. See also the
<a href="smbclient.1.html#mask"><strong>mask</strong></a> command.
<p><br>When recursion is toggled OFF, only files from the current working
directory on the source machine that match the mask specified to the
<a href="smbclient.1.html#mget"><strong>mget</strong></a> or <a href="smbclient.1.html#mput"><strong>mput</strong></a> commands will be copied,
and any mask specified using the <a href="smbclient.1.html#mask"><strong>mask</strong></a> command will be
ignored.
<p><br><a name="rm"></a> <li><strong><strong>rm &lt;mask&gt;</strong></strong> Remove all files matching mask from
the current working directory on the server.
<p><br><a name="rmdir"></a> <li><strong><strong>rmdir &lt;directory name&gt;</strong></strong> Remove the specified
directory (user access privileges permitting) from the server.
<p><br><a name="tar"></a> <li><strong><strong>tar &lt;c|x&gt;[IXbgNa]</strong></strong> Performs a tar operation - see
the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusT"><strong>-T</strong></a> command line option above. Behavior may be
affected by the <a href="smbclient.1.html#tarmode"><strong>tarmode</strong></a> command (see below). Using
g (incremental) and N (newer) will affect tarmode settings. Note that
using the "-" option with tar x may not work - use the command line
option instead.
<p><br><a name="blocksize"></a> <li><strong><strong>blocksize &lt;blocksize&gt;</strong></strong> Blocksize. Must be
followed by a valid (greater than zero) blocksize. Causes tar file to
be written out in blocksize*TBLOCK (usually 512 byte) blocks.
<p><br><a name="tarmode"></a> <li><strong><strong>tarmode &lt;full|inc|reset|noreset&gt;</strong></strong> Changes tar's
behavior with regard to archive bits. In full mode, tar will back up
everything regardless of the archive bit setting (this is the default
mode). In incremental mode, tar will only back up files with the
archive bit set. In reset mode, tar will reset the archive bit on all
files it backs up (implies read/write share).
<p><br><a name="setmode"></a> <li><strong><strong>setmode &lt;filename&gt; &lt;perm=[+|\-]rsha&gt;</strong></strong> A version
of the DOS attrib command to set file permissions. For example:
<p><br><code>setmode myfile +r</code>
<p><br>would make myfile read only.
<p><br></ul>
<p><br><a name="NOTES"></a>
<h2>NOTES</h2>
    
<p><br>Some servers are fussy about the case of supplied usernames,
passwords, share names (AKA service names) and machine names. If you
fail to connect try giving all parameters in uppercase.
<p><br>It is often necessary to use the <a href="smbclient.1.html#minusn"><strong>-n</strong></a> option when connecting to some
types of servers. For example OS/2 LanManager insists on a valid
NetBIOS name being used, so you need to supply a valid name that would
be known to the server.
<p><br>smbclient supports long file names where the server supports the
LANMAN2 protocol or above.
<p><br><a name="ENVIRONMENTVARIABLES"></a>
<h2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</h2>
    
<p><br>The variable <strong>USER</strong> may contain the username of the person using the
client.  This information is used only if the protocol level is high
enough to support session-level passwords.
<p><br>The variable <strong>PASSWORD</strong> may contain the password of the person using
the client.  This information is used only if the protocol level is
high enough to support session-level passwords.
<p><br><a name="INSTALLATION"></a>
<h2>INSTALLATION</h2>
    
<p><br>The location of the client program is a matter for individual system
administrators. The following are thus suggestions only.
<p><br>It is recommended that the smbclient software be installed in the
/usr/local/samba/bin or /usr/samba/bin directory, this directory
readable by all, writeable only by root. The client program itself
should be executable by all. The client should <em>NOT</em> be setuid or
setgid!
<p><br>The client log files should be put in a directory readable and
writeable only by the user.
<p><br>To test the client, you will need to know the name of a running
SMB/CIFS server. It is possible to run <a href="smbd.8.html"><strong>smbd (8)</strong></a>
an ordinary user - running that server as a daemon on a
user-accessible port (typically any port number over 1024) would
provide a suitable test server.
<p><br><a name="DIAGNOSTICS"></a>
<h2>DIAGNOSTICS</h2>
    
<p><br>Most diagnostics issued by the client are logged in a specified log
file. The log file name is specified at compile time, but may be
overridden on the command line.
<p><br>The number and nature of diagnostics available depends on the debug
level used by the client. If you have problems, set the debug level to
3 and peruse the log files.
<p><br><a name="VERSION"></a>
<h2>VERSION</h2>
    
<p><br>This man page is correct for version 2.0 of the Samba suite.
<p><br><a name="AUTHOR"></a>
<h2>AUTHOR</h2>
    
<p><br>The original Samba software and related utilities were created by
Andrew Tridgell <a href="mailto:samba-bugs@samba.org"><em>samba-bugs@samba.org</em></a>. Samba is now developed
by the Samba Team as an Open Source project similar to the way the
Linux kernel is developed.
<p><br>The original Samba man pages were written by Karl Auer. The man page
sources were converted to YODL format (another excellent piece of Open
Source software, available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/"><strong>ftp://ftp.icce.rug.nl/pub/unix/</strong></a>)
and updated for the Samba2.0 release by Jeremy Allison.

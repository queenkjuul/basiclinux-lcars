       catclose ?-fail | -nofail? cathandle
              Close  the  message catalog specified by cathandle.
              Normally, errors are ignored.  If -fail  is  speci-
              fied,  any  errors closing the message catalog file
              are returned.  The  option  -nofail  specifies  the
              default  behavior  of  not returning an error.  The
              use of -fail only makes sense if it was also speci-
              fied in the call to catopen.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.

NAME
       eval - Evaluate a Tcl script

SYNOPSIS
       eval arg ?arg ...?


DESCRIPTION
       Eval  takes one or more arguments, which together comprise
       a Tcl script containing one or more commands.   Eval  con-
       catenates  all  its  arguments  in the same fashion as the
       concat command, passes the concatenated string to the  Tcl
       interpreter  recursively,  and  returns the result of that
       evaluation (or any error generated by it).

       lvarcat var string ?string...?
              This  command treats each string argument as a list
              and concatenates them to the end of the contents of
              var,  forming  a a single list.  The list is stored
              back into var and also returned as the result.   if
              var does not exist, it is created.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.

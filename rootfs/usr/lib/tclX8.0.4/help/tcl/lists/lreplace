NAME
       lreplace - Replace elements in a list with new elements

SYNOPSIS
       lreplace list first last ?element element ...?


DESCRIPTION
       Lreplace  returns  a  new  list formed by replacing one or
       more elements of list with the element  arguments.   First
       gives  the  index  in  list  of  the  first  element to be
       replaced (0 refers to the first  element).   If  first  is
       less  than  zero  then  it  refers to the first element of
       list;  the element indicated by first must  exist  in  the
       list.  Last gives the index in list of the last element to
       be replaced.  If last is less than first then no  elements
       are  deleted;  the new elements are simply inserted before
       first.  First or last may be end (or any  abbreviation  of
       it) to refer to the last element of the list.  The element
       arguments specify zero or more new arguments to  be  added
       to  the  list  in  place of those that were deleted.  Each
       element argument will become a  separate  element  of  the
       list.   If  no  element  arguments are specified, then the
       elements between first and last are simply deleted.

NAME
       lappend - Append list elements onto a variable

SYNOPSIS
       lappend varName ?value value value ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  treats  the  variable given by varName as a
       list and appends each of the value arguments to that  list
       as  a  separate element, with spaces between elements.  If
       varName doesn't exist, it is created as a list  with  ele-
       ments given by the value arguments.  Lappend is similar to
       append except that the values are appended  as  list  ele-
       ments rather than raw text.  This command provides a rela-
       tively efficient way to build up large lists.   For  exam-
       ple,  ``lappend a $b'' is much more efficient than ``set a
       [concat $a [list $b]]'' when $a is long.

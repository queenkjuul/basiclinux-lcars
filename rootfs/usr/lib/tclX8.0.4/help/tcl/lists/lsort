NAME
       lsort - Sort the elements of a list

SYNOPSIS
       lsort ?options? list


DESCRIPTION
       This  command  sorts the elements of list, returning a new
       list in sorted order.  By default ASCII  sorting  is  used
       with  the  result  returned in increasing order.  However,
       any of the following options may be specified before  list
       to  control  the sorting process (unique abbreviations are
       accepted):

       -ascii              Use string comparison with ASCII  col-
                           lation order.  This is the default.

       -dictionary         Use dictionary-style comparison.  This
                           is the same as -ascii except (a)  case
                           is ignored except as a tie-breaker and
                           (b) if two  strings  contain  embedded
                           numbers,  the numbers compare as inte-
                           gers, not characters.  For example, in
                           -dictionary mode, bigBoy sorts between
                           bigbang and  bigboy,  and  x10y  sorts
                           between x9y and x11y.

       -integer            Convert  list elements to integers and
                           use integer comparison.

       -real               Convert  list  elements  to  floating-
                           point values and use floating compari-
                           son.

       -command command    Use command as a  comparison  command.
                           To  compare  two  elements, evaluate a
                           Tcl script consisting of command  with
                           the  two  elements  appended  as addi-
                           tional arguments.  The  script  should
                           return an integer less than, equal to,
                           or greater than zero if the first ele-
                           ment  is  to  be considered less than,
                           equal to, or greater than the  second,
                           respectively.

       -increasing         Sort  the  list  in  increasing  order
                           (``smallest'' items first).   This  is
                           the default.

       -decreasing         Sort  the  list  in  decreasing  order
                           (``largest'' items first).

       -index index        If this option is specified,  each  of
                           the  elements of list must itself be a
                           proper Tcl sublist.  Instead of  sort-
                           ing  based  on  whole  sublists, lsort
                           will extract the index'th element from
                           each  sublist  and  sort  based on the
                           given element.   The  keyword  end  is
                           allowed  for  the index to sort on the
                           last sublist element. For example,
                                  lsort -integer -index 1 {{First 24} {Second 18} {Third 30}}
                           returns {Second 18} {First 24}  {Third
                           30}.   This  option is much more effi-
                           cient than using -command  to  achieve
                           the same effect.

              Send  a  signal  to  the  each  process in the list

              signal  number  or the symbolic name of the signal,
              see the signal system call manual page.  The  lead-
              ing  ``SIG''  is optional when the signal is speci-
              fied by its symbolic name.  The default  for  signo
              is 15, SIGTERM.

              If  -pgroup is specified, the numbers in idlist are
              take as process group ids and the signal is sent to
              all  of  the process in that process group.  A pro-
              cess group id of 0 specifies  the  current  process
              group.

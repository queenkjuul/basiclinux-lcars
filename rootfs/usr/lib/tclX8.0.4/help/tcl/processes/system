       system cmdstr1 ?cmdstr2...?
              Concatenates  cmdstr1,  cmdstr2 etc with space sep-
              arators (see the concat command) into a single com-
              mand and then evaluates the command using the stan-
              dard  system  shell.   On  Unix  systems,  this  is
              /bin/sh  and  om Windows its command.com.  The exit
              code of the command is returned.

              This command differs from the exec command in  that
              system  doesn't return the executed command's stan-
              dard output as the result string, and  system  goes
              through  the  Unix shell to provide wildcard expan-
              sion, redirection, etc, as is  normal  from  an  sh
              command line.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.

NAME
       read - Read from a channel

SYNOPSIS
       read ?-nonewline? channelId

       read channelId numBytes


DESCRIPTION
       In  the first form, the read command reads all of the data
       from channelId up to the end of the file.  If the  -nonew-
       line  switch  is  specified then the last character of the
       file is discarded if it is a newline.  In the second form,
       the  extra  argument  specifies  how  many  bytes to read.
       Exactly that many bytes will be read and returned,  unless
       there  are  fewer than numBytes left in the file;  in this
       case all the remaining bytes are returned.

       If channelId is in nonblocking mode, the command  may  not
       read as many bytes as requested:  once all available input
       has been read, the command will return the  data  that  is
       available  rather  than  blocking  for  more  input.   The
       -nonewline switch is ignored if the command returns before
       reaching the end of the file.

       Read  translates  end-of-line  sequences in the input into
       newline characters according to  the  -translation  option
       for  the channel.  See the manual entry for fconfigure for
       details on the -translation option.

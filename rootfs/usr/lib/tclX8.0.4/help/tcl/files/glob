NAME
       glob - Return names of files that match patterns

SYNOPSIS
       glob ?switches? pattern ?pattern ...?


DESCRIPTION
       This  command performs file name ``globbing'' in a fashion
       similar to the csh shell.  It returns a list of the  files
       whose names match any of the pattern arguments.

       If  the  initial  arguments to glob start with - then they
       are treated as switches.  The following switches are  cur-
       rently supported:

       -nocomplain    Allows an empty list to be returned without
                      error;  without this  switch  an  error  is
                      returned if the result list would be empty.

       --             Marks the end of  switches.   The  argument
                      following  this  one  will  be treated as a
                      pattern even if it starts with a -.

       The pattern arguments may contain  any  of  the  following
       special characters:

       ?         Matches any single character.

       *         Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

       [chars]   Matches any single character in chars.  If chars
                 contains  a  sequence  of  the form a-b then any
                 character  between  a  and  b  (inclusive)  will
                 match.

       \x        Matches the character x.

       {a,b,...} Matches any of the strings a, b, etc.

       As with csh, a  ``.'' at the beginning of a file's name or
       just after a ``/'' must be matched explicitly or with a {}
       construct.   In  addition,  all  ``/''  characters must be
       matched explicitly.

       If the first character in  a  pattern  is  ``~''  then  it
       refers  to the home directory for the user whose name fol-
       lows the ``~''.  If the ``~'' is followed  immediately  by
       ``/''  then  the value of the HOME environment variable is
       used.

       The glob command differs from csh globbing  in  two  ways.
       First,  it  does  not  sort its result list (use the lsort
       command if you want the list sorted).  Second,  glob  only
       returns the names of files that actually exist;  in csh no
       check for existence is made unless a pattern contains a ?,
       *, or [] construct.


PORTABILITY ISSUES
       Unlike  other  Tcl  commands that will accept both network
       and native style names (see the filename manual entry  for
       details  on  how  native and network names are specified),
       the glob command only accepts  native  names.   Also,  for
       Windows UNC names, the servername and sharename components
       of the path may not contain ?, *, or [] constructs.

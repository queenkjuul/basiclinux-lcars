       link ?-sym? srcpath destpath

              Create  a  directory entry, destpath, linking it to
              the existing file, srcpath.  If -sym is  specified,
              a  symbolic  link, rather than a hard link, is cre-
              ated.  (The -sym option is only available  on  sys-
              tems that support symbolic links.)

              The link command is not available on Windows 95/NT.

              This command is provided by Extended Tcl.

       read_file ?-nonewline? fileName

       read_file fileName numBytes
              This  proecure  reads the file fileName and returns
              the contents as a string.  If -nonewline is  speci-
              fied,  then  the last character of the file is dis-
              carded if it is a newline.  The second form  speci-
              fies  exactly  how  many  bytes  will  be  read and
              returned, unless  there  are  fewer  than  numBytes
              bytes  left  in  the  file;  in  this case, all the
              remaining bytes are returned.

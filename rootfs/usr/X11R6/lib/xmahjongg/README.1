This program is very easy to get up and running.  You only have to run the
make and install it in your favorite directory.  We have played this game on
SUN systems (3 and 4) and microVaxes, so that is should work almost anywhere.
Unfortunately, I wrote this game to learn X11 and it shows.  I will clean
it up when I come out with the color version (very soon).

I would appreciate a copy of all modifications to the source so that I can
put out a new release when enough bugs are found.

The file 'xmahjongg.mk' is a very simple makefile for those of us who don't
understand imake.  Just change the first few lines to accomodate your system.

Remember that Mark A. Holm has the original copyright on the look of the tiles.
See his README file which is included below.

Enjoy!

MAHJONGG Version 1.0

Copyright 1988 Mark A. Holm

Permission is given to copy and distribute for non-profit purposes.

This game will operate on any Sun hardware that I know of with either
a monochrome or a color bit mapped tube running Sun 3.2 UNIX or later.
Most of the development was done on a Sun 100U running Sun 3.5.

Please Note!! The automagic screen type determination will not recognize
all screen types unless compiled with <sys/fbio.h> from a 3.5 OS. If
compiled with 3.2 not all monochrome types are recognized.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1.	Unpack this kit in an empty directory and edit the Makefile to
	set MANLOC and DESTDIR to the appropriate locations.

2.	run 'make install'.  

I have distributed the tiles as a compressed .o file to save on file
sizes and to preserve the artistic license of the game. If you would
like the source to the icons and the patches to iconedit so you can
modify them send a request (and possibly a small donation ;^) to the 
address below.

If you have any questions or problems/bug reports, send them to me:

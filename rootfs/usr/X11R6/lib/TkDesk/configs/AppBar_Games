###  AppBar (TkDesk Configuration File)
###
###  This file defines the contents and appearance of the Application Bar,
###  which can be opened from the "TkDesk" menu.
###
###  *** Press F5 to save changes and reload this file into TkDesk, 
###  *** F6 to do the same plus to close this window.
###
### -------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Whether to let the application bar be managed by the window manager.
### The "disadvantage" of this is that you get a border around the appbar
### window and that the appbar is not automatically present on all virtual
### screens. Note that you can MOVE the appbar by invoking the menu-entry
### "Application Bar/Move..." from the popup menu of the very first button.
### You can then drag the appbar around your screen by pressing the left
### mouse button and moving your mouse simultaneously. Strange, but this
### is by far the MFAQ.

set tkdesk(appbar,wm_managed) 0

### Max. number of buttons in one column resp. row of the application bar
### (when layout is vertical resp. horizontal):

set tkdesk(appbar,max) 19

###
### Definitions of fonts used in the time and date "button":

set tkdesk(appbar,font,time) -*-courier-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
set tkdesk(appbar,font,weekday) -*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
set tkdesk(appbar,font,day) -*-times-bold-r-*-*-24-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
set tkdesk(appbar,font,month) -*-helvetica-medium-o-*-*-12-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

###
### Set to 1 if you prefer 12-hour time display:

set tkdesk(appbar,12hour) 0

###
### Delay between updates of the load and mail display in seconds:

set tkdesk(appbar,load,delay) 15
set tkdesk(appbar,mail,delay) 30

###
### Images to be used for the xbiff replacement (mail notifier):

set tkdesk(appbar,mail,nomail) mailbox_empty.xpm
set tkdesk(appbar,mail,oldmail) mailbox_old.xpm
set tkdesk(appbar,mail,newmail) mailbox_full.xpm

###
### Background colour to change the mail icon to when new mail arrived,
### use "" if the colour should not be changed:

set tkdesk(appbar,mail,newbg) SlateGray

###
### Images to be used for the trash button:

#set tkdesk(appbar,trash,empty) next/rectrash.xpm
#set tkdesk(appbar,trash,full) next/rectrash_full.xpm
set tkdesk(appbar,trash,empty) next/recycle.xpm
set tkdesk(appbar,trash,full) next/recycle_full.xpm

### ------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Definition of the Application Bar (AB): The Application Bar is defined
### by the elements of a Tcl list.  (In the following I try to explain its
### structure, although it will probably best to just have a look at the
### example definition below.)
### 
### Each element of the list is again a Tcl list, whose first element is
### the file name of the image to use while the second is another Tcl list
### defining the popup menu associated with that button. If the image file
### name is not absolute, TkDesk will look for the image in each directory
### given by the variable tkdesk(path,images), which is defined in the
### config file "System". Supported formats are XBM, XPM, GIF, and P?M.
### If the image name starts with "special:" it is a special display button.
### Currently the following displays are implemented:
###
###   special:date - time and date display
###   special:load - system load display
###   special:mail - displays the status of your mailbox
###
### The popup menu list contains usually a set of 2-element lists. The
### first element always gives the label of the menu entry, while the
### second element contains a Tcl script to execute when this menu entry
### is invoked.
### 
### One label has a special meaning: If the label of an entry is "dd", the
### respective action will be executed when files are dropped on the
### button (their names can be accessed via %A in the action
### specification).  One-element lists inside the menu list are handled as
### follows: {-} adds a separator to the menu. If the list is one of
### {history:...}  or {config}, TkDesk will insert the corresponding menu
### at that place.  Otherwise the element is treated as a (disabled) menu
### entry, and can be used for inserting "headlines." Cascaded menus are
### also possible, have a look at the example below to see how they are to
### be defined.
### 
### A single click with the left mouse button always invokes the first
### menu entry of the corresponding popup menu. The menu gets posted when
### the right mouse button is pressed over an AB button.
###
### TkDesk commands that can be used in the list definition:
### (Only the most common ones are listed here. For a complete overview
### and a detailed explanation refer to the User's Guide.)
###
### dsk_exec cmd ...   : Executes shell command cmd in background.
### dsk_path_exec path cmd ... : Execute cmd in path.
### dsk_view cmd ...   : Executes cmd, displays output in Editor window.
### dsk_open_dir path  : Opens a new file list for directory path.
### dsk_open_browser path    : Opens a new file browser for directory path.
### dsk_edit file      : Edits file.
### dsk_du path        : Displays disk usage of directory path.
### dsk_periodic cmd seconds : Executes cmd every x seconds.
### dsk_confirm text script  : Executes script when confirmation was positive.
### dsk_read_string label script  : Executes script when entered string is
###                      not empty. "label" will be displayed in the dialog.
### dsk_sound id       : Plays sound id (defined in config-file Sounds). 
### dsk_cbhelp file regexp   : Invokes TkDesk's help system on file.
### dsk_ask_exec       : Asks for a command to execute.
### dsk_ask_dir        : Asks for a directory to open.
### dsk_save_config    : Saves window layout, history, bookmarks etc.
### dsk_exit ?ask?     : Quits TkDesk. "ask" may be one 1 or 0.
###
### Abbreviations that will be replaced with file names etc.:
###
### %s : Full pathname of the first selected file.
### %f : Its filename only.
### %b : "Basename": just the filename without extension.
### %d : Its directory only.
### %A : List containing full pathnames of all selected resp. dropped files.
### %B : Same as %A, but will be replaced with "" if no files are selected.
### %D : Directory of last "ative" viewer.
### %x : Current X selection.
###
### The very first Button provides access to a few functions of TkDesk,
### like history menus, configuration menu etc. Its labels are mostly
### "internally reserved" keywords.
### The second button is only defined by the magic word "date" which inserts
### TkDesk's date display at that place into the AB.

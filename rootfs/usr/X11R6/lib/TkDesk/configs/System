### =========================================================================
###  Shell Command Settings
### =========================================================================

### The defaults are all quite "BSD'ish". If you're not sure if they work for
### you, just try to run TkDesk with these settings (they should be okay in
### most cases).

set tkdesk(cmd,whoami) "whoami"		;# used to determine user's login name
set tkdesk(cmd,du) "du"		        ;# for Disk Usage: usage in KB
set tkdesk(cmd,df) "df"			;# for getting free disk space in KB
set tkdesk(cmd,sort) "sort -rn"		;# for Disk Usage: list biggest first
set tkdesk(cmd,cp) "cp -r"		;# copy recursively
set tkdesk(cmd,mv) "mv -f"		;# move and rename
set tkdesk(cmd,rm) "rm -rf"		;# delete recursively and don't ask
set tkdesk(cmd,ln) "ln -f"		;# for "hard" links
set tkdesk(cmd,symln) "ln -sf"		;# for symbolic links
set tkdesk(cmd,touch) "touch"		;# to create new files
set tkdesk(cmd,mkdir) "mkdir"	        ;# to create new directories
set tkdesk(cmd,print) "lpr"             ;# default command for printing
set tkdesk(cmd,netscape) "netscape"     ;# command for surfing :-)
set tkdesk(cmd,mail) "mail -s %s %a"    ;# mailing, %s: subject, %a: address

### The following specifies the command to be used when "Execute as
### Superuser" is selected in the "Options" menu, or when the dsk_exec_as_root
### function is used.  "%c" will be replaced with the actual command that
### is to be used:

set tkdesk(cmd,su,exec) {xterm -sb -T "%c" -n "%c" -e su root -c "%c"}
#set tkdesk(cmd,su,exec) {xterm -sb -T "%c" -n "%c" -e sudo %c}

### The same for viewing command output ("View output" checked):

set tkdesk(cmd,su,view) {xterm -sb -T "%c" -n "%c" -e pauseme su root -c "%c"}
#set tkdesk(cmd,su,view) {xterm -sb -T "%c" -n "%c" -e pauseme sudo %c}


### =========================================================================
###  Editor Settings
### =========================================================================

### Your favourite editor (for quick edits):
### (If you want to use a terminal based editor such as vi (yes, there
### actually are people doing that!), note that you have to replace
### "builtin" with "xterm -e vi" or sth. similar.)

set tkdesk(editor,cmd) "builtin"   ;# Of course! ;-)

### Can your editor take more than one file on the command line?
### (The builtin can, so this is set to 1.)

set tkdesk(editor,mfiles) 1

###
### The following settings are only for the built-in editor:

set tkdesk(editor,font)		    $tkdesk(font,text)
set tkdesk(editor,print_command)    "lpr"
set tkdesk(editor,default_geometry) "80x25"
set tkdesk(editor,auto_indent) 1
set tkdesk(editor,brace_indent) 1
set tkdesk(editor,do_backups) 1
set tkdesk(editor,cursor) black

###
### Preset the way the editor handles long lines (none, char, or word):

set tkdesk(editor,wrap) char

###
### Whether to use "real" tabs, or replace them with tab_width blanks:

set tkdesk(editor,real_tabs) 1
set tkdesk(editor,tab_width) 8

###
### If you have problems with Backspace and Delete appearing to be
### "swapped", uncomment the following lines:

#set tmpbnd [bind Text <BackSpace>]
#bind Text <BackSpace> [bind Text <Delete>]
#bind Text <Delete> $tmpbnd
#set tmpbnd [bind Entry <BackSpace>]
#bind Entry <BackSpace> [bind Entry <Delete>]
#bind Entry <Delete> $tmpbnd
#unset tmpbnd

set tkdesk(focus_follows_mouse) 1

###
### Line width of the focus rectangle:

set tkdesk(focus_width) 2

### Should desk items be managed by the window manager?  This would allow

### not decorate windows of class "dsk_DeskItem".

set tkdesk(desk_items,wm_managed) 0

### The maximum line width of desktop icon labels in character.
### TkDesk will break the filename at the closest suitable character.

### has finished, uncomment and modify the following line:

#set tkdesk(after_startup) {cb_info "Hi! How are you today?"}

### If you want some Tcl code to be executed right before shutdown
### of TkDesk, uncomment and modify the following line:

#set tkdesk(at_exit) {cb_info "Bye, and have a nice day!"}

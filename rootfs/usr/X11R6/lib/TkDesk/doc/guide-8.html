<H2><A NAME="s8">8. Frequently Asked Questions </A></H2>


<P>This section is intended to give answers to the most frequently asked
questions about TkDesk.  This file is derived from the emails I'm
receiving, so if you think something is missing just tell me about it
(<CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:zzhibol@rrzn-user.uni-hannover.de">zzhibol@rrzn-user.uni-hannover.de</A></CODE>).</P>

<H2><A NAME="apppos"></A> <A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 How can I change the position of the application bar?</A></H2>


<P>You can drag the application bar around simply by holding down the
Alt- or Meta-key and simultaneously pressing the left mouse button
over the application bar. You can also invoke the
&quot;Move...&quot; entry from the comet button's popup menu to do
the same without having to press Alt/Meta.</P>
<P>Since version 1.0b1 the configuration file "AppBar" sets also a
variable named tkdesk(appbar,wm_managed) which can be used to have the
apllication bar managed by the window manager, although this is
usually not necessary.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 Can I have transparent icons?</A></H2>


<P>No, but have a look at the answer to the next question.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 How can I change the background colour of the icons and desk items?</A></H2>


<P>The background colour of icons used when the window manager iconifies
a window can be set in the configuration file "System". The variable
you are looking for is tkdesk(color,icon_background). By setting this
variable to the same colour as your root window you can achieve the
effect of transparent icons. You can define the colour either as a
normal name (such as "grey", "blue") or in the form #rrggbb.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 How can I have a different set of desk items on each virtual screen? </A></H2>



<H3>FVWM and similar or derived window managers</H3>


<P>First, you have to set the variable
<CODE>tkdesk(desk_items,wm_managed)</CODE> in the System config file to 1.
Then you have to configure fvwm to not decorate windows of class
<CODE>dsk_DeskItem</CODE>. For instance:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Style &quot;dsk_DeskItem&quot;    NoTitle, NoHandles, WindowListSkip, BorderWidth 0
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H3>CDE window manager</H3>


<P>As for FVWM, you first have to set the variable
<CODE>tkdesk(desk_items,wm_managed)</CODE> in the System config file to 1.
To tell the CDE window manager (dtwm) to not decorate desk items you
have to add the following line to either the file Dtwm or .Xdefaults
in your home directory, and then restart dtwm:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Dtwm*dsk_DeskItem*clientDecoration:  none
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss8.5">8.5 Binding to execute (export foo=bar; program;) doesn't work.</A></H2>


<P>Yes, this is a bit tricky. What you need to do is the following:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
dsk_exec sh -c {export foo=bar; program}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss8.6">8.6 Composing characters doesn't work in TkDesk's editor.</A></H2>


<P>Currently you have to edit the file cb_tools/bindings.tcl in TkDesk's
library directory to make this work.  Locate the two lines containing
the word &quot;XKB&quot;; all you need to do is to comment out the
following lines by prepending a '#'.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss8.7">8.7 I'd like TkDesk to do this and that. How can I achieve this?</A></H2>


<P>The first place to start are the various configuration files of TkDesk.
These can be accessed either by the "TkDesk/Edit Config Files" menu
of the file browser windows, or by the "Configuration" submenu of the
popup menu of the very first button of the application bar of TkDesk.
<CODE>:-)</CODE></P>
<P>Since TkDesk uses Tcl as the language for its configuration, and these
configuration files are simply "source"ed, you could add any sort of
Tcl proc for instance to the configuration file "System". This proc
would then be available in every other configuration file as well.
With the set of commands provided by TkDesk, which are listed e.g.
in the configuration file "Popups", TkDesk provides a very powerful
platform for the user who knows Tcl.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss8.8">8.8 Is there a TkDesk mailing list? </A></H2>

TkDesk at mrj.com.  Just send a mail to

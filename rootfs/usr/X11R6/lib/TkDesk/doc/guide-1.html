<P><B>Please note:</B> As of TkDesk 1.0b5, this guide unfortunately has
become slightly out of date.  To find out what has changed or been
added since this guide was written, please take a look at the change
log (&quot;Help/Changes&quot;), even if you're a first time user.</P>
<P>TkDesk is a graphical desktop manager for UNIX (especially Linux) and the X
Window System.   Compared with other file managers available, it offers the
most complete set of file operations and services, plus gives the user
the ability to configure most aspects of TkDesk in a powerful
way.  The reason for this is the use of Tcl/Tk as the configuration and
(for the greatest part of TkDesk) implementation
language.  TkDesk has been influenced by various other systems and file
managers: NeXT, for laying out the file browser windows,
Apple Finder, for the idea of file annotations and, (shock horror),
Windows 95, for some other (of course minor and unimportant) inspirations.</P>
<P>This is a brief overview of the most prominent features of TkDesk:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Arbitrary number of automatically refreshed file browsers and
file list windows,</LI>
<LI> Configurable file-specific popup-menus,</LI>
<LI> Drag and drop,</LI>
<LI> Files and directories may also be dropped onto the root window,
a.k.a. desktop,</LI>
<LI> Configurable application bar, with several displays and
cascaded popup menus for
each button, files can also be dropped here,</LI>
<LI> History of visited directories, opened files, executed commands,
and others, which is automatically saved to disk,</LI>
<LI> Find files through their annotation, name, contents, size or age,</LI>
<LI> Trash can for safe deletion of files and directories,</LI>
<LI> Calculation of disk usage for directory hierarchies,</LI>
<LI> All file operations (find, copy, disk usage, etc.) are carried out in
the background,</LI>
<LI> Traversal of directory hierarchies through recursive cascaded menus,</LI>
<LI> Bookmarks, create menu entries for often used files/directories,</LI>
<LI> Comprehensive hypertextish online help,</LI>
<LI> Built-in multi-buffer and undo-capable editor,</LI>
<LI> Close coupling with Netscape for displaying HTML files or
selected URLs,</LI>
<LI> Sound support,</LI>
<LI> Powerful configuration of nearly all aspect of TkDesk through
Tcl/Tk, this also allows the Tcl-literate to extend TkDesk in
arbitrary ways,</LI>
<LI> Free of charge! But see the file <CODE>COPYING</CODE>, or menu
entry <CODE>Help/License</CODE> for
information on usage and redistribution of TkDesk.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Acknowledgments </A></H2>


<P>TkDesk uses a number of other freely available packages without which
TkDesk would not have been possible.  I'd like to say many thanks to
the following people:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Chris Sterritt for setting up and managing the TkDesk mailing list
(at
<CODE>
<A HREF="mailto:majordomo@mrj.com">majordomo@mrj.com</A></CODE>,
send a mail with the body &quot;subscribe tkdesk&quot; to join),</LI>
<LI> Ken Hornstein for his wonderful netscape-remote package,</LI>
<LI> Ioi Kim Lan for making an XPM image reader for Tk available,</LI>
<LI> George Howlett for his great BLT, of which parts are used by TkDesk,</LI>
<LI> Michael McLennan for his massively useful <CODE>[incr tcl]</CODE>,</LI>
<LI> John Ousterhout for Tcl/Tk, which is definitely the best thing
since sliced bread,</LI>
<LI> Greg Hankins and Matt Welsh for putting together the most
wonderful linuxdoc-sgml package,</LI>
<LI> and of course, Linus Torvalds whose Linux kind of changed my
life, really!</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>And a very big thank you to the growing TkDesk user community,
which provides me with a constant flow of bug reports (getting less
now <CODE>:-)</CODE>), suggestions for enhancements of TkDesk, and lots of
motivation and encouragement.</P>
<P>Special thanks to Chuck Robey for revising a previous version of
this guide.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Using TkDesk's Help System </A></H2>


<P>If you have Netscape running, TkDesk will use that for displaying
this User's Guide on-line.  Otherwise, to reduce overhead, TkDesk
uses its own, rather sophisticated help system.  It features
hypertext links, context sensitivity (which is not yet utilised by
TkDesk) and full text search. </P>
<P>The help window consists of three areas:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> A listbox listing all the section headings.  A section can be
selected by pressing the left mouse button,</LI>
<LI> the text display, which contains the actual help text, and</LI>
<LI> a button &quot;Back&quot;, which jumps back after a hypertext
link has been followed (see next paragraph), a button
&quot;Close&quot; which closes the help window, and a text entry.  In
this entry a regular expression can be entered (such as
<CODE>[Ff]eatures</CODE>).  After hitting <CODE>Return</CODE>, the whole help
text is searched for this expression.  Pressing <CODE>Return</CODE> again
continues the search.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>Text that is displayed blue in the help window is a hypertext
link.  When the left mouse button is clicked over such a link the
display will automatically change to the referenced section.  One can
jump back by pressing the &quot;Back&quot; button described above.</P>
<P>The following keys are bound when the mouse pointer is inside the help
window:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B><CODE>Tab</CODE></B><DD><P>Moves to the next section.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>Shift-Tab</CODE></B><DD><P>Moves to the previous section.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>Control-Tab</CODE></B><DD><P>Moves to the first section.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>Control-Shift-Tab</CODE></B><DD><P>Moves to the last section.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>Up, Down</CODE></B><DD><P>Scrolls one line up/down.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>Page up, Page down</CODE></B><DD><P>Scrolls one page up/down.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>Control-Home</CODE></B><DD><P>Jumps to start of help text.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>Control-End</CODE></B><DD><P>Jumps to end of help text.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>Meta/Alt-b</CODE></B><DD><P>Equivalent to pressing the
&quot;Back&quot; button.</P>
<DT><B><CODE>Meta/Alt-c, Escape</CODE></B><DD><P>Equivalent to pressing the
&quot;Close&quot; button.</P>
</DL>
</P>


<H2><A NAME="cmdopts"></A> <A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Command Line Options </A></H2>


<P>Usually TkDesk is started simply by executing the command
&quot;<CODE>tkdesk</CODE>&quot; from the shell prompt or your X
initialisation file.  The command line options understood by TkDesk are
the following:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>-configdir <I>dir</I></B><DD><P>Reads the configuration from
directory <I>dir</I> instead of <CODE>~/.tkdesk</CODE>.</P>
<DT><B>-default</B><DD><P>Reads the default configuration of TkDesk 
instead of the user's one in <CODE>~/.tkdesk</CODE>.</P>
<DT><B>-fvwm</B><DD><P>TkDesk uses the icon window facility only if fvwm is
the current window manager.  Since other window managers may also
support icon windows, or TkDesk maybe unable to detect you're running
fvwm, this command line option forces TkDesk to use icon windows.  The
advantage of these is that they look nicer and files can be dropped on
them.</P>
<DT><B>-iconic</B><DD><P>Iconifies all file browser and file list windows
created by TkDesk during start-up.</P>
<DT><B>-startdir <I>dir</I></B><DD><P>If this option is given,
the first file browser will open with directory <I>dir</I>.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>For example, the command &quot;<CODE>tkdesk -fvwm -iconic</CODE>&quot;
forces Tkdesk to use icon windows and starts with all windows iconified.</P>

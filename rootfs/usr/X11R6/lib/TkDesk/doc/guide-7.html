<H2><A NAME="config"></A> <A NAME="s7">7. Configuration of TkDesk </A></H2>


<P>Currently, TkDesk can be configured only by editing ASCII files.  This
is not necessarily a drawback, because this way you can add complex
Tcl/Tk procedures to the configuration files, but if you don't know
Tcl/Tk you would probably prefer a dialog-based configuration.  This
should be implemented in a future release of TkDesk.</P>
<P>If you don't know Tcl/Tk: don't despair!  For the biggest part of
TkDesk's configuration files it is absolutely not necessary for you to
know how to program in Tcl/Tk, since you just have to modify values or
extend the examples I have provided. And to those who want to exploit
all of the power available by using Tcl/Tk as TkDesk's configuration
language, have a look at the answer to FAQ
<A HREF="guide-8.html#tcltk">Where can I find out more about Tcl/Tk?</A>.</P>
<P>The configuration files can be accessed from the <CODE>TkDesk</CODE> menu
via the entry <CODE>Edit Config Files</CODE>, or from the
&quot;Configuration&quot; submenu of the popup menu of the
application bar's first button (I should really call this the
&quot;comet-button&quot; or something similar).  The built-in editor
will then appear with the selected configuration file(s)
already loaded.  Each configuration file contains rather detailed
comments on what the individual settings are for, and how they can be
modified.  Well, at least they contain examples, which can guide your
modification attempts.  Once you have modified the configuration file,
you can save it and reload it into TkDesk making use of the entries of
the editor's &quot;TkDesk&quot; menu described in section
<A HREF="guide-6.html#editor">The Built-in Editor</A>. Use F5 to save the file
and reload it into TkDesk, and F6 to do the same but additionally
close the configuration file.</P>
<P>The following sections briefly describe what the individual
configuration files are used for by TkDesk, and what settings can be
defined by them.</P>
<P>As already mentioned, each configuration file contains directions on
how to modify its definitions.  The general advice is: just look at
the example definitions, because these make things clearer than lots
of explanations can. And don't be shy, but experiment! It's easier
than you might think, really!</P>

<H2><A NAME="appbar"></A> <A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 AppBar </A></H2>


<P>This configuration file lets you define all aspects of the application
bar (apart from its geometry, use the entries of the submenu
&quot;Application Bar&quot; of the comet-button's popup menu for
this). This is what you can define here:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> If the application bar should be managed by the window manager
just as an ordinary window. I don't like this, so this is disabled by
default <CODE>:-)</CODE>.</LI>
<LI> The maximum number of buttons in a column (vertical layout) or
row (horizontal layout). Yes, the application bar can contain several
columns or rows!</LI>
<LI> The fonts to use for the time and date display.</LI>
<LI> The actual button definitions, ie. which image to display, and
the entries of the (possibly cascaded) popup menu. See the
&quot;AppBar&quot; file itself for the syntax used. TkDesk comes
with a rich set of b/w XBM and colour XPM images, these are located in
the <CODE>images</CODE> subdirectory of TKDesk's library directory. You
can find out where this is by looking at the fifth line of the
<CODE>tkdesk</CODE> script.</LI>
</UL>
</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 ButtonBar </A></H2>


<P>This file defines the contents and appearance of the Button Bar,
which is displayed underneath the menu bar of TkDesk's file browser
or file list windows. Both button bars are configured independently
from one another.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Commands </A></H2>


<P>In this file you can define entries which will be added to TkDesk's
&quot;Command&quot; menu, for example to uncompress all selected
files or do whatever you can possibly imagine.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Directories </A></H2>


<P>Here you can define entries and cascaded submenus of directories which
will be added to TkDesk's &quot;Directories&quot; menu. More details
are contained in the &quot;Directories&quot; file itself.</P>
<P>You can also define a list of directories whose parent directories are
not to be displayed in file browser windows, as is usually the case
with your home directory. This can speed up display of directories
underneath an AFS directory, for instance.</P>
<P>Another list lets you define action that are to be performed when a
specific directory is opened. This can be used for example to
auto-mount floppy and CDROM drives.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 FileTags </A></H2>


<P>Contains definitions for color and font of specific file types, that
will be used in TkDesk's file lists. Also the icons displayed when the
&quot;Add Icons&quot; option is selected are configured here, as
well
as the icons used for the desk items, i.e. files and directories which
have been dropped on the root window. </P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Popups </A></H2>


<P>The popup menus that appear when the right mouse button is clicked
over a file or directory are defined here. There are individual
definitions for the popup menus of directories, executables, and of
other files.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.7">7.7 Sounds </A></H2>


<P>Here the command to be used for playing sounds can be defined, as well
as the sound files which are to be played at certain events.
TkDesk comes
with a few VOC sound files which are located in
the <CODE>sounds</CODE> subdirectory of TkDesk's library directory. You
can find out where this is by looking at the fifth line of the
<CODE>tkdesk</CODE> script.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss7.8">7.8 System </A></H2>


<P>All the more &quot;basic&quot; features of TkDesk can be configured
here. These are:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Colours to be used by TkDesk,</LI>
<LI> Fonts to be used by TkDesk,</LI>
<LI> Default geometry of file listboxes,</LI>
<LI> Definitions of shell command which are used by TkDesk to copy,
move, delete etc. files. These should be fine as they are in most cases.</LI>
<LI> The default command for printing,</LI>
<LI> Which editor to use, plus settings for the built-in editor,</LI>
<LI> Periods for automatic refreshing of the file lists and saving
of TkDesk's configuration,</LI>
<LI> Maximum number of entries in history menus,</LI>
<LI> If TkDesk should ask for confirmation when the user wants to
quit TkDesk,</LI>
<LI> If TkDesk should allow the menus to be &quot;tearoff-able&quot;,</LI>
<LI> The paths in which TkDesk will look for images and sounds used
in the configuration files,</LI>
<LI> Icons to use for file list and browser windows, and for the
help window,</LI>
<LI> And if TkDesk should try to emulate Motif as closely as possible.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>And that's it! Well, for the moment at least...</P>

<H2><A NAME="fileinfo"></A> <A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 File Information </A></H2>


<P>The &quot;File Information&quot; window displays detailed
information about a file. It can also be used to change the owner or
access-permissions of a file. In addition, an annotation to a file can
be added here.</P>
<P>The following information is displayed:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Path</B><DD><P>The path of the file.</P>
<DT><B>Size</B><DD><P>The size of the file in bytes.</P>
<DT><B>Modified</B><DD><P>When the file was last modified. By clicking on
the button displaying the date file can be &quot;touched&quot;,
ie. their modification timestamp will be set to the current time.</P>
<DT><B>Owner</B><DD><P>Displays the owner of the file. By clicking the
button displaying the owner, the owner can be changed to another user.</P>
<DT><B>Group</B><DD><P>Displays the group ownership of the file. By clicking the
button displaying the group's name, the group can be changed.</P>
<DT><B>Mode</B><DD><P>Here the access permissions are displayed in &quot;ls
-l&quot; style. The first three button correspond to the rights of
the owner (r: may read, w: may write, x: may execute or open the
directory), the second three buttons to the rights of the group, and
the last three buttons to every one else's rights. The &quot;x&quot;
button are special in that they cycle through four settings:
<CODE>x</CODE> for executable, <CODE>s</CODE> for set user/group id
<I>and</I> executable, <CODE>S</CODE> for set id only, and <CODE>-</CODE>
for not executable. If the settings any of these buttons is changed,
the &quot;Change Mode&quot; button at the bottom edge of the window
must be clicked to actually change the file's permissions.</P>
<DT><B>Links</B><DD><P>Number of (hard) links to this file.</P>
<DT><B>Type</B><DD><P>Tries to give some information about the file's
contents. TkDesk uses the shell command <CODE>file</CODE> for this.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>In the &quot;Annotation&quot; text field you can enter any remarks
about the file. This annotation will be saved when the
&quot;Close&quot; button is pressed. If the window displays
information about a file an additional button labeled &quot;Disk
Usage&quot; is provided, which calculates the disk usage of the
hierarchy rooted at that directory. The entries of the &quot;Disk
Usage&quot; window can be double-clicked to open new file list
windows. </P>


<H2><A NAME="copydel"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Copying, Moving and Deleting Files </A></H2>


<P>These functions can be accessed from the &quot;File&quot; menu.  There is
one dialog for copying, moving and linking files, one dialog for
renaming files (which does nothing else than moving the file
to its new name), and one dialog for deleting files.</P>
<P>The &quot;Rename&quot; dialog is very straight-forward and probably does
not need further explanation.  The &quot;Copy etc.&quot; dialog contains
the obvious source and destination entry fields, plus a checkbutton
labeled &quot;all selected files&quot;.  If more than one file is
selected and this checkbutton is checked (default) the operation will
be applied on all selected files.  If it is not checked, each file will
be handled individually.  The &quot;Skip&quot; button can then be used for
skipping individual files.</P>
<P>The &quot;Delete&quot; dialog also contains this checkbutton, plus a
checkbutton labeled &quot;REALLY delete&quot;.  If this checkbutton is
checked, the files will <I>not</I> be moved to the trash can but
will be <B>really and finally deleted!!</B>  The default setting of
this checkbutton can be set from the &quot;Options&quot; menu.</P>



<H2><A NAME="findfiles"></A> <A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Finding Files </A></H2>


<P>The &quot;File&quot; menu contains two entries for finding files:
&quot;Find Files...&quot; and &quot;Find Annotation...&quot;. Files can be
annotated through their &quot;Info&quot; dialog (accessible from the
&quot;File&quot; menu or from their popup menu), see section
<A HREF="#fileinfo">File Information</A>.</P>
<P>&quot;Find Annotation&quot;
enables you to look for an annotated file whose annotation matches a
certain regular expression (which can be as simple as an ordinary
string).</P>
<P>&quot;Find Files&quot; lets you look for files (or rather: let's you
instruct TkDesk to look for files) whose name match a certain pattern,
which are of a certain type (such as directory), which contain a
certain string, which are smaller or bigger than a certain number of
kilobytes or which are younger/older than a certain date.
All fields which are not left blank in this dialog will be combined
with a logical AND. This dialog is currently the only one utilizing
the balloon help capability of TkDesk, so for now I would like to
refer you to this.  For instance, if you want to know how to enter the
file size you're looking for, place the mouse pointer over the
&quot;Size&quot; entry field without moving it for a few seconds.</P>
<P>Both &quot;Find&quot; dialogs display their results in the same file
listboxes that are used by the file list and browser windows,
so the same bindings described in section
<A HREF="guide-2.html#bind">Handling of the Listboxes (Bindings)</A>
apply here as well!</P>

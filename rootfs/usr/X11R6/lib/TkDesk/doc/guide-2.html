<H2><A NAME="s2">2. The File Browser Window </A></H2>


<P>The file browser window is the largest window when TkDesk is started
for the first time.
It contains a menu bar, a button bar (for fast
access to the most often used file operations and other functions),
an entry field (displaying the current directory),
a horizontal scrollbar,
a certain number of file listboxes (three by default), and a
status and information bar.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 The Menu Bar </A></H2>


<P>The following sections describe the entries of the individual menus of
the file browser windows.</P>

<H3>TkDesk </H3>


<P>The &quot;TkDesk&quot; menu contains the following entries:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>New Browser...</B><DD><P>Asks for a directory for which to open a new file browser window.  If
the directory is the empty string, the operation is cancelled.</P>
<DT><B>Clone Window</B><DD><P>Creates a new file browser window with the same directory as the
current one (that is, the directory of the file browser from which
this menu entry was invoked).</P>
<DT><B>Application Bar</B><DD><P>Opens the application bar if it had been closed before, or raises the
application bar above all other windows.</P>
<DT><B>Edit Config Files</B><DD><P>This is a submenu from which individual or all configuration files of
TkDesk can be opened to modify them.</P>
<DT><B>Reread Config Files</B><DD><P>Another submenu whose entries reread individual or all configuration
files. </P>
<DT><B>Auto Save</B><DD><P>Here you can select which parts of TkDesk are automatically saved
periodically and when TkDesk exits.</P>
<DT><B>Save All Now</B><DD><P>Saves all parts of TkDesk's configuration no matter what the settings
in the previous submenu.</P>
<DT><B>Close Window</B><DD><P>Closes the file browser window.</P>

</DL>
</P>

<H3>File </H3>


<P>This menu provides all the usual file operations plus entries for
finding files.  The contained menu entries are:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Information</B><DD><P>Opens a file information window for each
currently selected file.  This window, which can also be used to add
annotations to files, is described in section
<A HREF="guide-4.html#fileinfo">File Information</A>.</P>
<DT><B>New File...</B><DD><P>Asks for the name of a file which will be
created in the current directory of the file browser or list.</P>
<DT><B>New Directory...</B><DD><P>Asks for the name of a directory which will be
created in the current directory of the file browser or list.</P>
<DT><B>Copy, Move, Link...</B><DD><P>Opens a dialog box for copying, moving,
linking, and symbolic linking of files.  If the currently selected file
is a tar archive the dialog contains an extra button labeled
&quot;Untar&quot;.  This dialog window is described in more detail in
section 
<A HREF="guide-4.html#copydel">Copying, Moving and Deleting Files</A>.</P>
<DT><B>Rename...</B><DD><P>For each selected file, TkDesk asks for a new
name.  Before actually renaming TkDesk checks for an existing file with
the same name.</P>
<DT><B>Delete...</B><DD><P>Opens a dialog to delete files.  The
section 
<A HREF="guide-4.html#copydel">Copying, Moving and Deleting Files</A>
gives more details.</P>
<DT><B>Print...</B><DD><P>Asks for a command to print the currently selected
files.  The names of the selected files will be appended to the
command.  The default command can be defined in the configuration file
&quot;System&quot;.</P>
<DT><B>Find Files...</B><DD><P>Opens a dialog window which can be used to
search for files, using a variety of characteristics.  This dialog is
described in more detail in section
<A HREF="guide-4.html#findfiles">Finding Files</A>.</P>
<DT><B>Find Annotation...</B><DD><P>Lets you search for files with a certain
annotation.  More details in section 
<A HREF="guide-4.html#findfiles">Finding Files</A>.</P>
<DT><B>Copy To X Selection</B><DD><P>Copies the complete names of all currently selected files
(i.e. including their paths) to the X clipboard.  They can then be

<DT><B>Open Selected Files</B><DD><P>For each currently selected file, the default action is performed.</P>
</DL>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="dir"></A> Directories </H3>


<P>The main purpose of this menu is to select directories which are to be
opened.  It also manages TkDesk's trash can.  The menu contains the
following entries:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Open...</B><DD><P>Asks for a directory.  A new file list or file browser window will be
created, baesed on the setting of the &quot;In Browser&quot; checkbutton.</P>
<DT><B>New...</B><DD><P>Asks for the name of a directory which will be
created in the current directory of the file browser or list.</P>
<DT><B>Home Directory</B><DD><P>Changes the directory of the window from
which this entry is invoked to the user's home directory.</P>
<DT><B>Trees</B><DD><P>Contains two cascaded submenus: &quot;Home&quot;
and &quot;Root&quot;.  The contents of these submenus is dynamically
generated and corresponds to the directory hierarchy rooted either at
the user's home directory or at &quot;/&quot;.  Selecting an entry
from these submenus changes the directory of the window to the
selected directory.  Pressing <CODE>Control</CODE> at the same time opens a
new window with this directory.</P>
<DT><B>Trash</B><DD><P>Opens a file list window displaying the contents of
the trash can.  When this window is iconified and TkDesk uses icon
windows the icon can be used as a Mac-like trash can.</P>
<DT><B>Empty Trash</B><DD><P>Empties the trash can after confirmation from
the user.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>The remaining entries can be configured by the configuration file
<CODE>Directories</CODE>.  See section 
<A HREF="guide-7.html#config">Configuration of TkDesk</A> for details on how to do this.   If one of these menu
entries is invoked, the path of the file browser will change to that
directory.   If such an entry is invoked while at the same time
pressing the Control key, a new file list window will be created (if
the option &quot;Always In Browser&quot; is selected a file browser
window will be created), displaying the contents of the selected
directory.  This feature applies to <B>all</B> menus that contain
directory names!</P>


<H3>Commands </H3>


<P>This menu provides entries to execute commands either once or
periodically, and provides some &quot;job control&quot;.  Its entries
are:  </P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Execute...</B><DD><P>Asks for a command to execute.  The button to the right of the command
entry contains a history of previously executed commands.  Selecting
one of these copies its name to the entry widget.</P>
<DT><B>Periodic Execution...</B><DD><P>Opens a window which can be used to
execute a command and watch its output periodically.  If the
&quot;Don't execute&quot; checkbutton is selected, the execution is
paused. </P>
<DT><B>Job Control</B><DD><P>Opens a window which allows to stop, terminate,
kill etc. processes which have been started by TkDesk.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>The remaining entries can be defined in the configuration file
<CODE>Commands</CODE>.  See section
<A HREF="guide-7.html#config">Configuration of TkDesk</A> for details on how to
do this.  If one of these menu entries is invoked, the corresponding
command will be executed.</P>


<H3>Bookmarks </H3>


<P>This menu lets you create bookmarks for often used files and
directories.  To do this, select at least one file/directory and invoke
the &quot;Add Bookmark&quot; menu entry.  The name(s) of the selected
files and directories will now appear alphabetically sorted
in the &quot;Bookmarks&quot;
menu.  You can remove any bookmark from the menu by selecting its
corresponding entry from the &quot;Remove Bookmark&quot; submenu.</P>
<P>The bookmarks you add will be automatically saved, if the
&quot;Bookmarks&quot; entry of the &quot;Auto Save&quot; submenu
contained in the &quot;TkDesk&quot; menu is selected
(which is the default).</P>

<H3>Options </H3>


<P>The <CODE>Options</CODE> menu lets you configure many aspects of TkDesk
&quot;on the fly&quot;.  The entries are:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Add Icons</B><DD><P>If selected, pretty little images will appear
left of the file names in the file listboxes.  This looks nice, but has
currently a major drawback: It is very slow.  For this reason this
option is by default deselected.</P>
<DT><B>Show All Files</B><DD><P>Whether to show files in the file
lists whose name start with &quot;.&quot;.</P>
<DT><B>Folders On Top</B><DD><P>If selected (default) folders will
always appear on top of the file lists.</P>
<DT><B>Append Type Char</B><DD><P>Whether to append a file-type
specific character to the file names.  This is mainly intended for
monochrome displays and is then automagically selected.</P>
<DT><B>Single Click (Dirs)</B><DD><P>Lets you open directories with a single
click of the left mouse button.  Individual directories can still be
selected by pressing <CODE>Control</CODE> at the same time.</P>
<DT><B>Always In Browser</B><DD><P>If this option is selected, the &quot;In
Browser&quot; checkbutton of the &quot;Open Directory&quot; dialog
will always be selected. <CODE>Control-Doubleclick</CODE> on a directory
will open a file browser instead of a file list window.</P>
<DT><B>Strip &lt;your home directory&gt;</B><DD><P>If this is
selected, and the current path of the browser is somewhere under your
home directory, the leftmost file listbox will contain your home
directory rather than the root directory. This speeds up the display
of directory hierarchies under your home directory.</P>
<DT><B>Overwrite Always</B><DD><P>If this option is selected, TkDesk
won't ask if the destination file already exists when copying or
moving files.</P>
<DT><B>Really Delete</B><DD><P>Relates to the deletion of files. If
this option is selected, the &quot;Delete Files&quot; dialog box
will always have the &quot;REALLY delete&quot; checkbutton
selected by default.</P>
<DT><B>Quick Drag'n'Drop</B><DD><P>Normally when you drop files onto a
file list, the copy dialog appears. If this option is selected,
dropped files will be moved to the destination directory without
further questions. If <CODE>Control</CODE> is pressed during dropping, the
files will be copied. If the drop target is the trash can, TkDesk will
ask if the files are to be deleted &quot;really&quot;.</P>
<DT><B>Sort History</B><DD><P>This option determines whether the
history menus are to be sorted alphabetically or not.</P>
<DT><B>Use Sound</B><DD><P>If you have sound working with TkDesk on your
machine, you can temporarily disable sound by selecting this
option. Handy when playing Audio CDROMs, for instance.</P>
<DT><B>Dialogs at Pointer</B><DD><P>If selected, TkDesk will always try to
place new windows right under the mouse pointer.</P>
<DT><B>Number Of Listboxes</B><DD><P>This relates to the number of
listboxes in the file browser window. Between 1 and 6 can be
displayed, though 18 would theoratically not be a problem.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>The settings of these options are by default automatically saved.
This can be disabled by deselecting the &quot;Options&quot; entry of
the &quot;TkDesk/Auto Save&quot; submenu.</P>

<H3>Help </H3>


<P>This menu tries to give you some help with using TkDesk.  It also
contains entries for displaying the list of FAQs, recently made
changes to TkDesk, and the license for using and
distributing TkDesk, as well as an option for activating or
deactivating the balloon help. The setting of the ballon help entry
will be saved together with the ones of the &quot;Options&quot;
menu. </P>
<P>And then there is the most important menu entry of TkDesk:
&quot;About TkDesk...&quot; Make sure you invoke it at least once!</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 The Button Bar </A></H2>


<P>The button bar allows you fast access to more often used functions of
TkDesk, or other commands. When you place the mouse button over any of
these buttons, a small help window will appear telling you what this
button does (provided the &quot;Balloon Help&quot; option is activated).</P>
<P>The contents of this button bar can be defined via the
configuration file <CODE>ButtonBar</CODE>. See section
<A HREF="guide-7.html#config">Configuration of TkDesk</A> and the configuration
file itself for details on how to do this.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 The Path Entry </A></H2>


<P>This entry field displays the current path of the file browser or
file list. You can
also type directly into this field to change the display to another
directory.  There is a sort of &quot;auto-completion&quot;
available; if you type only the first part of a directory's name and
press Control-Tab, its name will be automagically completed. That is,
provided there is no other directory starting with the same letters.</P>
<P>If you click the right mouse button over this field a popup menu
appears which lets you select any of the current directory's parent
directories.</P>
<P>The button to the right of the entry field contains a menu of the last
20 (default) directories you have visited. If you select one of these,
the current path of the browser will change to it. The
&quot;Control-trick&quot; described in section
<A HREF="#dir">Directories</A> works here as well!</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 The File Listboxes </A></H2>


<P>The main part of the file browser are the file listboxes.  Directories
are by default displayed in blue with a bold font, executable files
in red and bold, and regular files in black and a medium
font.  These settings can be configured via the <CODE>System</CODE>
configuration file.  The color and font of individual file types can be
configured via the <CODE>FileTags</CODE> configuration file.  See section
<A HREF="guide-7.html#config">Configuration of TkDesk</A> for details on how to
do this.</P>
<P>Every listbox contains a &quot;long&quot; listing of its directory.
You can make
the hidden parts visible by scrolling the listbox with the horizontal
scrollbar at its bottom border.  Every listbox also contains a menu,
which can be accessed by clicking on the listbox's title.  It contains
entries for:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Refreshing the listbox.  Although TkDesk refreshes all its file
lists every 5 seconds (default), sometimes you may want to have a file
listbox instantly updated.</LI>
<LI> Calculating the directory's disk usage, i.e. the number of
bytes occupied by that directory and all its subdirectories.  A window
will appear when this has been done, containing a sorted list of all
subdirectories and their individual disk usages.  If you double-click
on any of its entries, a new file list window will appear displaying the
directory's contents.</LI>
<LI> Executing a command in the listbox's directory. All the usual
%-shortcuts my be used (see section
<A HREF="guide-7.html#config">Configuration of TkDesk</A>).</LI>
<LI> Setting a mask for the listbox's display.  For example, you can
configure the listbox to only display files matching the pattern
<CODE>*.gif</CODE>.</LI>
<LI> Sorting the listbox's contents, either by Name, Size, Date,
Extension, or not at all.</LI>
<LI> Displaying all files, that is also those
starting with a &quot;.&quot;.</LI>
<LI> Inverting the listing.</LI>
<LI> Open a new file list window displaying the directory's contents.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>This menubutton can also be used to drop files, as well as to drag the
directory displayed in the associated listbox to another target, e.g.
the root window.</P>

<H3><A NAME="bind"></A> Handling of the Listboxes (Bindings) </H3>


<P>The handling of the file lists is very similar to that of the NeXT
file manager: when you double click on a directory, the listbox right
to the current one will display this directory's contents.  You can
open a directory in this listbox, and the listbox right to this one
will display its contents.  This way you can browse through complete
directory hierarchies, while having instant access to the contents of
the complete directory tree. When the number of opened directories
exceeds the number of visible listboxes, you can scroll the listboxes
with the horizontal scrollbar which is located right above the file
lists.</P>
<P>Files are selected with the left mouse button.  A single click selects
a single file, deselecting all other files. If the Control key is
pressed simultaneously, the old selection will be retained. By
dragging the mouse pointer over a file list, while at the same time
pressing the left mouse button, a set of files can be selected.
Shift-doubleclick selects all files in that file list.  Holding down
the shift button extends the current selection unto that file
(&quot;range-selection&quot;).</P>
<P>Note that if the option &quot;Single Click (Dirs)&quot; is set a
single click on a directory will open it. Then you need to use
Control-Click to select a single directory.</P>
<P>A double click performs the default action for the selected file.  For
directories that opens the directory, for executables it executes
it, and for files it invokes the first entry of the corresponding popup
menu (see below). If the Control key is pressed while double-clicking
a directory, a new file list or file browser window (depending on the
setting of the &quot;Always In Browser&quot; option)
is created displaying the contents
of that directory.  For files, a dialog box will appear asking for a
command to execute on that file.</P>
<P>Files can be dragged by pressing the middle mouse button on any
selected file. If no file is selected, the clicked-on file will be
selected.  Files can be dropped by releasing the mouse button over any
other file listbox and the menubutton above them,
over windows of the built-in editor, over the
application bar (if the corresponding button has been configured to
handle dropped files), over iconified file browsers and file lists
(only if TkDesk is in &quot;fvwm-mode&quot;, see section
<A HREF="guide-1.html#cmdopts">Command Line Options</A>) and in general over any
other application supporting the <CODE>file</CODE> protocol of the BLT
package's drag and drop implementation.
Valid drop targets can be identified by looking at the window
that is displayed while files are dragged: the window's relief appears
raised if over a valid target, flat if not.</P>
<P>The right mouse button is used in the file listboxes to access the
file-specific popup menu. Every popup menu contains a submenu, labeled
with the file's name, which contains entries for the most common file
operations. The remaining entries of the menu can be configured via
the configuration file <CODE>Popups</CODE>. See section
<A HREF="guide-7.html#config">Configuration of TkDesk</A> for details on how to
do this.</P>



<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 The Status Bar </A></H2>


<P>The status bar is located at the bottom edge of file browser windows.
It displays either</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> the current state of TkDesk,</LI>
<LI> details of the currently selected file, or</LI>
<LI> number and summed size of currently selected files.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

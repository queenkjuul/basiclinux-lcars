 How To Get Started With TkDesk Really Quickly  (V1.0)
 =============================================================================

	
 What's On Desk
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When you start TkDesk for the first time, it comes up with it's default
 window layout.  This is:

   o The Application Bar (or appbar for short) -- that's the vertical
     row of buttons on the left hand side of the screen, and
     
   o A File Browser Window (or browser) containing three file listboxes.
     This is the "main" window of TkDesk used for file operations like
     copy, move etc. (in fact, you can have several of such browsers).

 There's also a smaller variant of the browser window: the File List
 Window.  This is a compact version of the browser with just one file
 listbox.


 The Application Bar
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each button provides a pop-up menu that can be accessed by pressing the
 right mouse button over any of the appbar's buttons.  Clicking the first
 mouse button over an appbar button invokes the first entry of the pop-up
 menu.  The appbar can be moved around by pressing the Meta- or Alt-key
 and the first mouse-button at the same time over the appbar.

 Summary of mouse button bindings (1: left, 2: middle, 3: right button):
 
    		1:  Invokes first entry of associated pop-up menu.
    		3:  Displays associated pop-up menu.
       Meta/Alt-1:  Move the application bar around.
       Meta/Alt-2:  Shortcut to TkDesk's configuration files.

 The first appbar button gives access to some more often used functions
 of TkDesk, and to most history lists managed by TkDesk.  It also contains
 an entry to change the layout of the appbar to horizontal, if that's what
 you prefer.
 

 The File Browser Window
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The main part of the file browser windows are the file listboxes.
 They are laid out such that the left listbox always displays the contents
 of the parent directory of the file listbox to the right.  As you traverse
 a directory tree, listboxes "move off" the visible area to the left. The
 large horizontal scrollbar on top of the listboxes can be used to make them
 visible again.

 Summary of mouse button bindings (1: left, 2: middle, 3: right button):

                1:  Select directory or file.
        Control-1:  Single-select directory or file.
          Shift-1:  Range-select directories or files.
           Drag-1:  Select an area.
   Shift-Double-1:  Select all items.
         Double-1:  Open directory or file (actually invokes the
		    first entry of the associated pop-up menu).
    Ctrl-Double-1:  Directory: Open file list window with this directory.
		    File: Open file interactively.
           2-Move:  Drag directory or file.  Can be dropped on
		    other file listboxes, some appbar buttons,
		    or the desktop (root window).
                3:  Display associated pop-up menu.

 The button right above each file listbox displaying the name of the
 directory whose contents is displayed in the listbox is a menu button.
 Pressing the first mouse button over it displays a menu of operations
 applicable to the contents of the listbox.
 
 
 The File List Window
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 File list windows can be opened by opening a directory while pressing
 the Control key, or by entries from the browser's "Directory" menu.
 The default directory popup menu also contains an entry for this purpose.
 The main difference of the file list window compared with a browser window
 is that the contents of directories you open are always displayed in the
 same file listbox.

 For the list of mouse bindings please refer to the previous section.


 Get going!
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hopefully, this is enough to get you started with TkDesk.  Note that
 there is a "Help" menu button in the menu bar of the file browser
 window.  It gives access to the TkDesk User's Guide, which documents
 every tiny feature of TkDesk (not yet though).  Also note that TkDesk
 has a "balloon help" feature: just place the mouse pointer over any
 button of the application bar or button bar in the browser window.

 And now it's your turn:  Start exploring TkDesk!  Look into every
 menu, click on every button, and take a look at the User's Guide!
 Please also take a look at "Help/Changes", even if you're a first-time
 TkDesk user.  It explains many of the less obvious TkDesk features.
 
 When you've become a bit more familiar with TkDesk you will want to take
 a look at TkDesk's configuration files (Menu "TkDesk/Configuration").
 Virtually every aspect of TkDesk can be configured!  Just experiment with
 the default configuration.


 
 Enjoy TkDesk!!

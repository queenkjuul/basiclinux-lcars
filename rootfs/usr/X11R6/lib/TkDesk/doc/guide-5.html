<P>TkDesk provides you with an application bar for fast access to your
favorite applications, commands, directories etc., plus displays for
the current date and time, system load, and the status of your mailbox.
It consists of an arbitrary number of buttons.
Each button (also the aforementioned displays) contains a popup menu which
can be accessed by pressing the right mouse button over any of them.
If you single-click the left mouse button over such a button, the first
(active) entry from the corresponding popup menu will be invoked.</P>
<P>The first button
(displaying a comet) could be called TkDesk's
&quot;Start Button&quot;,
although I would prefer &quot;Take-off Button&quot;
<CODE>;-)</CODE>.
Its popup menu
contains entries for accessing TkDesk's most often used functions,
such as executing a command or opening a file list or browser window, plus
submenus for your bookmarks, the files you most recently opened, and the
directories you've last visited. The next entry is a submenu labeled
&quot;Application Bar&quot;. Here you can configure all aspects of
the application bar, especially its <B>position and orientation</B>.
See my answer to the MFAQ 
<A HREF="guide-8.html#apppos">How can I change the position of the application bar?</A> for more.
The last entry labeled &quot;Configuration&quot; contains another
submenu which gives you fast access to TkDesk's configuration files.</P>
<P>The remaining two entries allow you to configure the application bar
and TkDesk to your heart's content. See section
<A HREF="guide-7.html#config">Configuration of TkDesk</A> for details on how to
do this.</P>
<P>The second button with the question mark gives you access to this guide
to TkDesk, and lets you view manual pages, also making use of a running
TkMan (which is a hypertextified manual pager which is to be highly
recommended). This button also allows you to drop executables on it to
automatically display their manual page, if they have got one.</P>
<P>All the other buttons can be configured by you! See section
<A HREF="guide-7.html#config">Configuration of TkDesk</A> for details on how to
do this.</P>

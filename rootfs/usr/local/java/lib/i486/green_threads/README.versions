NOTE: the libc.so and libdl.so are not part of the standard JRE; 
they are from the regular Linux distribution.

Here's what versions the Linux libraries are derived from: 
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           14 Oct  1 07:20 /lib/libc.so.5 -> libc.so.5.4.44
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           14 Oct  1 07:18 /lib/libdl.so.1 -> libdl.so.1.9.6

[H[J[40;36;1mWelcome to the BasicLinux 3.5 LiveCD

BL3 is a mini-Linux designed specifically for old PCs. It provides extensive 
networking capabilites (including dial-up PPP), a user-friendly shell and an 
assortment of utilities. BL3 also has a slim version of the X GUI and some 
applications (including the MagicPoint presentation tool). The BL3 kernel has 
been customized to minimize the memory footprint on old PCs. Enhanced kernels
and additional packages are located on the LiveCD which you can switch to after
installing to hard drive. All official kernel modules are installed to 
/lib/modules, and all official BasicLinux add-ons are already installed.
You can install packages from LiveCD/packages/slackwar after installation.

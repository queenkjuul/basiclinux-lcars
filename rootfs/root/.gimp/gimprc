# This is your personal gimprc file.  Any variable defined in this file
# takes precedence over the value defined in the system-wide gimprc:
# ${prefix}/share/gimp/gimprc
# (where ${prefix} is /usr)
# Take a look at that file if you want to see some of the options that
# can be set here.

# Most values can be set automatically within the GIMP, if you press
# the "save" button after changing some options in the Preferences
# dialog box.  You can also edit this file by hand, and the GIMP will
# always try to do the right thing when saving new options after you
# have edited this file.

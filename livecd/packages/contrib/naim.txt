***THE OFFICIAL BASICLINUX 3.5 NAIM PACKAGE IS ALREADY INSTALLED IN BL3-LCARS***
***THE OFFICIAL PACKAGE IN THE PARENT DIRECTORY IS RECOMMENDED***

--naim-uclibc.tgz is a version of naim compiled statically against uclibc. 
It can be installed and used without addition of any other packages--just 
issue pkg naim-uclibc.tgz to install it. NOTE: currently, it will not run 
under X (in a terminal), but only from a console.

--naim-0.11.8.3.1-i486-1tfn.tgz is a non-static package someone compiled for 
Slack12 (it was downloaded from the 'net). This version of naim will only 
run under BL3 if updated libraries are present and ncurses has been added 
from Slack4. For BL3 library updating, see Steven's instructions for 
installing Opera.
